# TMC Insider version

**Thank you to those who use the Insider version of TMC and [report issues](https://github.com/rage/tmc-vscode/issues/new/choose) they encounter.**  
<small>Existing users have been randomly selected.</small>

**NB!** You can always opt-out from the Insider version by going to Visual Studio Code, press the TMC icon at the activity bar, select `Settings` from the menu and toggle off `Insider version`.

We have implemented an insider version to our extension. You can see from [changelog](https://github.com/rage/tmc-vscode/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) features that are currently available for Insiders.

If you opt-in to our insider version you will be receiving new features up for testing. If something doesn't work in the insider version you can always opt-out and use the stable version by going to Visual Studio Code, press the TMC icon at the activity bar, select `Settings` from the menu and toggle off `Insider version`.

Reporting an issue.
- Try do the same without insider version on, does this work?
- Open a [bug report](https://github.com/rage/tmc-vscode/issues/new/choose) and answer the questions, please mention if you use insider version.

If we don't encounter any major issues, we will be releasing these changes to everyone.
