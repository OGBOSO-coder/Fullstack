A special variant for the fire department is available as well. • Typ 251 - a closed box-van type transporter ready to deliver goods from local firms, the mail, and perhaps even smuggle contraband. • Typ 253 - the classic people-carrier. You’ll find this version having space for eight people, of which one can act as a door-gunner if needed. The Typ 253 finds usage everywhere from family commuting to the police department or as taxi service.<br><br><!--StartFragment--><div class=\"img-wrapper\"><a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/gm_15_civ.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/gm_15_civ.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\" height=\"\" width=\"\"><\/a><\/div><br><\/p> <h4>W123<\/h4> <p>The W123 is an absolutely iconic staple of 1980s motoring.

It can seat four people inside, plus one unlucky (<em>and totally not kidnapped<\/em>) passenger in the trunk of the vehicle.<\/p> <h4>Stop, Police!<\/h4> <p>With the inclusion of the famed West German GSG 9, we’re introducing a complete set of new unique units.

This means that all objects and props are now available in the editor with their overview and description. You can now build your own village anywhere on Gabreta, or a different map.<\/p> <p>Regarding new features, we added a population script that can be helpful for mission makers to populate all enterable houses in Gabreta. Using it, players can be easily surprised by any AI on the floors or roofs of houses at any time.<\/p> <p>New smoke and sparking effects were added to all vehicles when their engines are damaged.<\/p> <h2>FIXING 1.0<\/h2> <p>Finally, regarding fixes, sound sets on vehicles, weapons, launchers, firearms, and surfaces due to echo during gunfire were completely reworked and improved. <\/p> <p>We also modified some damage resistance on all vehicles due to feedback from the community.<\/p> <p>Some PIP periscopes on BVPs, M113, and LAV25 were fixed and improved. Bodies and textures of CSLA and FIA soldiers were touched too.<\/p> <p>The amount of fixes and improvements contains more than 300 lines, and some of them are grouped.<\/p> <h2>SPECIAL OFFER<\/h2> <p>Finally, to mention something special, we added the flag and coats of arms of Ukraine to the CDLC, and the previously released standalone desert pack is now fully included in the CDLC (this pack will be removed from Steam soon).<\/p> <p>Last but not least, as was mentioned earlier, as a large bonus the complete AFMC faction was added. The AFMC faction was originally introduced in our Mod in Arma 2 as “Armed Forces of the Midland Coalition.” Now, due to some requests from the community, they are “back in business.”<\/p> <p>This fictitious faction was added to the BLUFOR side and equipped with BLUFOR vehicles and characters dressed in specific camo patterns.<\/p> <p>The list of available vehicles and weapons for the AFMC is large. You will find for example VADS, LAV-25, M113, MLRS, M923 5t trucks, AH-1 and UH-60 helicopters, and M1 tanks in dedicated (as we call it) “green dragon camo.” For infantry, you can then choose between specialized Airborne troops, standard Infantry, or Special Forces.<\/p> <h2>THANK YOU<\/h2> <p>We would like to say a big THANK YOU to all our supporters and subscribers.

We received a couple community requests over the time to bring back the old AA12 from Arma 2’s PMC DLC. The AA40 is our take on that.<\/li> <li>Tura raiders and the SFIA have gained access to the SA-77, a unique South African made Light Machine Gun, while the UNA upgraded their arsenal with the SA-77 Compact, which isn’t such a heavy carry and can be deployed faster. Considering this weapon is not seen in many games, it felt like a great candidate for our project.<\/li> <li>Completely new in our lineup are dedicated CTRG (Desert) faction classes, which primarily sport the new Velko R5 rifle - a smaller and lighter upgrade to the existing R4. The R5 is also available with an optional GL 203 grenade launcher attachment.<\/li> <li>The GLX 40mm is a stand-alone grenade launcher system. To adhere to Arma 3’s alternative reality 2035 scenario, we decided to make it capable of firing 3GL stack besides regular 40mm grenades, which greatly enhances its fire and suppression power. This one is a personal favourite of mine and was specifically added because I needed it in my life.<\/li> <\/ul> <p><\/p> <p> We also wanted to take this opportunity to flesh out the lineup of rifle attachments a little bit. You’ll now find a new “stubby” sound suppressor, a red dot sight, and an IR flashlight in your arsenal. While working on those, we also took the time to expand the camo selection of existing attachments such as the Mk17 Holosight, RCO, and IR Laser Pointer, which should cover most of your fashion choice needs in the base game. <\/p> <p> Since those attachments can be used on any rifle and not just ours, they help to visually freshen up base game weaponry. Sure you've been using the same MX, Katiba, or SPAR rifle for years now, but thanks to the new optics and suppressors, they gain a new shine even though not much has actually changed! <\/p> <p> Last but not least, we decided to throw in a couple clothing variants of vanilla Arma 3 and our CDLC assets into the mix. Their intent is to not just spice things up for players, but to offer modders the ability to create uniform variants that weren’t possible before, such as low visibility attire in any color.<br><br><!--StartFragment--><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-0eee8a0c-7fff-8667-20db-38f6755eca34\"><span style=\"border:none;display:inline-block;overflow:hidden;width:602px;height:269px;\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/XwhtOfN_ANEPQpf9QepgIsYucPRciO1KVvnbSxpG-gPzxO8qZg6IDY0jqLVlNz7zFZQ42cpOh15kYCIADMWWqFAt-lcuSboAbYsMNz_KQYI40Tr_Ih1pekgRlrNQUGGBDpqdRCkJf_-T22sBhp8n8CXuQh02hdZcja7bmrNjA1o6XuQxiMF8InbT6Q\" style=\"margin-left:-65.78556701030928px;margin-top:-58.351612174388535px;\" width=\"747.2247422680413\" height=\"418.47029139703784\"><\/span><\/span><!--EndFragment--><br> <\/p> <h4>VEHICLES<\/h4> <p> We are introducing new variants of Arma 3’s MSE-3 Marid in an unarmed and open-top (.50 cal machine gun) configuration. Lore-wise, its main purpose is to serve as a technological bridge for our SFIA faction, which while actively supported by CSAT forces, does not have the same access to modern equipment. <\/p> <p> The new BTR-T Iskatel on the other hand has been added simply to provide a visual alternative to Arma 3’s strong focus on RCWS turrets. However, to spice things up a little bit, it's also decked out with an additional batch of Vorona wire-guided missiles, thus sparking fear in every tank operator who is forced to face it in a hot combat situation. <\/p> <p> The contender for the most unique vehicle asset is probably our new IED drone. Self-made from looted AP-5 Bustard gun drones and turned into grenade carriers with scrap metal and electronics, the small, agile IED drone strikes fear into every soldier on the battlefield. <\/p> <p> That said, a notable major change regarding the existing AP-5 Bustard gun drone has been added as well: it now supports every primary rifle in the game, or community-made modification. Want to attach our new GLX grenade launcher? You can. Want to attach a heavy machine gun instead? You can. We explicitly did not add any limitations in weight or size, to offer the most possible freedom for mission creators.

Enemy patrols come equipped with new weaponry, and the Tura quick response forces have upgraded their looted arsenal with the new .50 cal Marid.

Even more special is the fact that a lot of new players are still joining the ranks. Welcome to you all! We hope you enjoy the vast amount of content available to you, official and from the community alike. You may not know this, but we used to publish these blogs every single week during prime-time development. Things have slowed down, as we've discussed in our preview reports, but the platform is still supported by a small crew. There have continued to be platform updates and many experimental branch releases. And the Creator DLC program is still seeing plenty of activity too. In the broader Armaverse, much has happened of course. The Enfusion era of Arma was started with the early access release of Arma Reforger. Many of Bohemia's developers are working on those projects now, working very hard to stabilize and expand that young platform. In this report we will try to provide a status update on how Arma 3's development was influenced, if at all. Read on and see you in-game!<br><\/p><p><br><\/p><h2>INTELLIGENCE<br><\/h2><p>We'll start by taking a tour of the biggest updates released this past year, beginning with the platform. <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/post\/spotrep-00100\" target=\"\">Update 2.06<\/a> was released just after the <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/post\/sitrep-00240\" target=\"\">previous report<\/a> and was covered there. Earlier in 2022 we also did publish <b><a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/post\/spotrep-00102\" target=\"\">update 2.08<\/a><\/b> with a few stand-out new features, besides a myriad of fixes and support for mods. As of that update, <b>Steam Rich Presence<\/b> is supported in Arma 3 (unless you opt out via the Stream Friendly UI toggle). It shows Steam friends when you are playing Arma 3 and what you are currently doing within the game, such as playing a certain scenario or just idling in a menu and waiting for an invite. It also groups players who are in a multiplayer session together in the friends list for a better overview. Another fun toy was the addition of <b>scripted lasers<\/b> via <a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/drawLaser\" target=\"\">drawLaser<\/a>. If you'd like to witness a showcase of this one, fire up the CoF: Gray Firing Drill. Make it to Miller's Fortress of Fun and enter 2 0 8 into the 'binary jukebox'.<br><\/p><p>More recently, we've released <b><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ArmaPlatform\/status\/1562043327847047169\" target=\"\">update 2.10<\/a><\/b>. It again contained a plethora of support for community developers in the form of many script commands and Event Handlers. You may not see the results of these very directly, but they should over time make for even better mods and custom scenarios. In terms of bigger features, let's begin with the rather experimental ability to <b>deform terrain heightmaps by script<\/b>. This is one of those features we were hesitant to add, because it can effectively break the game when used in more extreme ways. But it also offers some cool new opportunities in community content, such as creating tactical positions not present in the vanilla terrain. These changes should even work in savegames and multiplayer, but please use the tech with some care. A few disclaimers are available on the Community Wiki entry for <a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/setTerrainHeight\" target=\"\">setTerrainHeight<\/a>.<br><\/p><p><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\"><div class=\"center-block\" style=\"max-width: 400px\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ArmaPlatform\/status\/1562043327847047169\"><\/a><\/blockquote><\/div><\/p><p>The big one for 2.10 was of course a set of <b>Thermal Imagery enhancements<\/b>. We've been reading your feedback and realize not everybody liked this as much. Let's offer some insights into what was actually fixed and changed. TI was first introduced to the Real Virtuality engine for <a href=\"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/33930\/Arma_2_Operation_Arrowhead\/\" target=\"\">Arma 2: Operation Arrowhead<\/a>. It has seen evolutions and data improvements in Arma 3, but nothing fundamental. TI via infrared sensors requires a simulation of the temperature of the world and everything in it. It's basically an interpretation of the delta differences of those temperatures. Our engine does this for actively simulated entities, such as characters, their weapons, and vehicles. Many static objects in the world do not have a dedicated temperature simulation, so here some approximation is used based upon their color texture for example. That means it's by no means a perfect simulation of TI and has its limitations (as does real TI), which will not likely be overcome for Arma 3. But there were some long-standing issues that we finally had a chance to address.<br><\/p><p><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\"><div class=\"center-block\" style=\"max-width: 400px\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/dedmenmiller\/status\/1522996841557676032\"><\/a><\/blockquote><\/div><\/p><p>Specifically, the <b>contrast range<\/b> was very flat. Everything got compressed down to an almost uniform gray. The update opened this range up to allow seeing more details. In addition, the <b>vanilla terrains<\/b> have had their <b>ambient temperatures<\/b> updated to better reflect their geolocation (prior the update, they were mostly all the same). We feel it helped in many cases, but can understand it also makes hot entities stand out less. It also tends to exaggerate some of the existing limitations on objects such as rocks and vegetation. In response to such feedback, we've compressed the contrast range a little bit in a <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/post\/spotrep-00106\" target=\"\">hotfix<\/a>. And we've added <a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/setTIParameter\" target=\"\">script commands<\/a> to manipulate this range, even almost back to prior flat levels. Another fix was made to the <b><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/dedmenmiller\/status\/1522996841557676032\" target=\"\">sky line<\/a><\/b>, which now is more clearly and correctly distinguished at the horizon (i.e. dark). A tiny bit of <b>noise<\/b> was also added to the screen. Finally, there's the new addition of a <b><a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Post_Process_Effects#Resolution\" target=\"\">\"Resolution\" Post Process effect<\/a><\/b>. It's not being used in vanilla content, but mods can make use of it to simulate dynamic resolution scaling based on optic zoom levels.&nbsp;The <i><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/rhsmods\" target=\"\">RHS<\/a><\/i> mod team has already shared a <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/rhsmods\/status\/1571445100722688000\" target=\"\">preview<\/a> of how they will be using it.

It lets the player take the role of a Private Military Contractor and be deployed to the desert dunes of fictional Sefrou-Ramal. It reintroduces the iconic ION PMC faction and also comes with new vehicle variants, weapons, clothing, and gear. Everything comes together in the \"Extraction\" co-operative multiplayer scenario, which sees you complete a dynamic series of random contracts and resolve a war correspondent's kidnapping in a conflict zone.

As you've come to know by now, we typically don't share details until any updates or releases are final and approved. So stay tuned to our channels for news.<br><\/p><p><br><\/p><h2>OPERATIONS<br><\/h2><p>In our opening paragraph, we posed the question how Arma 3's development was affected by changes and announcements this past year. In short, we are actually still operating in a very similar manner as described in the <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/post\/sitrep-00240\" target=\"\">last report<\/a>. In its <i>OPERATIONS<\/i> section you will find a description of the game's <b>Live Ops<\/b> mode that is still applicable. And it will continue to be like that going into the next year. So you may find this section reads very similar to last year's, which we tend to see as a good thing. It means we are still operating at a similar level and have not yet started a next - and therefore lower intensity - phase in the game's long lifecycle. We constantly keep an eye on several factors: the relevance of the game (still high), our available resources and several more. Some of the remaining devs, including yours truly, have also begun work on a completely unrelated <a href=\"https:\/\/enfusionengine.com\/\" target=\"\">Enfusion<\/a> project in Amsterdam. It's also fair to say that while most of the Live Ops crew don't work directly on <a href=\"https:\/\/reforger.armaplatform.com\/\" target=\"\">Arma Reforger<\/a>, we are all Bohemians and therefore invested in the future of Arma. We help out where we can, because this pioneering work will lay the foundations for the next decades. That means we don't have full-time focus on Arma 3 anymore, but it does not mean we've stopped working on it. There are still weekly Dev-Branch updates, ad hoc Profiling branch updates, <i><a href=\"https:\/\/www.battleye.com\/\" target=\"\">BattlEye<\/a><\/i> anti-cheat updates, etc. Nobody expected we'd still be able to work on the game in its 10th year (more if you count Early Access and internal development), and we're here for it!<br><\/p><p>Perhaps you read the above and came away confused about what these \"branches\" are. While a lot of readers will have been with us for years, many are new. <b><a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Arma_3:_Steam_Branches\" target=\"\">Steam branches<\/a><\/b> are special-purpose versions of Arma 3 available via the Steam client, which you can opt into . Go to the game's properties and select the <i>BETAS<\/i> tab. Some branches are always available and you can just select them, others are time-limited and \/ or require an access code. Selecting another branch does require you to download the difference in data, which can be small or rather large. Here's a quick overview of the primary Steam branches and their intended audience:<br><\/p><ul><li><i>Main Branch<\/i>: or default branch is what you play if you just install the game. It's where most players should be, since it's the most stable version. It's also what's required for most multiplayer servers.<\/li><li><i>Development Branch<\/i>: or Dev-Branch is an experimental build that is as close as possible to our internal development version. We try to update it every week - normally on Wednesdays - but if we have other priorities or lack the staff, we may skip it. This is mostly for people interested in trying new features or fixes for a bit. Modders tend to preview upcoming changes here too. The branch is not multiplayer-compatible with Main Branch. It receives a quick smoke test before release, but can easily contain issues. Trivia: we used to update this branch every single day, which was quite intense, but has helped the game's early development a lot. Change logs are posted <a href=\"https:\/\/forums.bohemia.net\/forums\/topic\/140837-development-branch-changelog\/\" target=\"\">here<\/a>.<\/li><li><i>Profiling Branch<\/i>: originally intended to diagnose multiplayer and performance issues, this branch has become an interesting testbed of late. Its rule remains that it must be compatible with Main Branch, so if some fix there interests you, feel free to use it (no longer does it require an access code). It's also a relatively small download, since it only contains the game's binaries and no data. In the past year a few low-level optimizations and fixes were first trialed here, sometimes for months. But do remember this is a fully untested build that can simply be broken. We try to monitor for issues and respond quickly, but just switch back to Main if you encounter problems. A heads-up to us on <a href=\"https:\/\/discord.com\/invite\/arma\" target=\"\">Discord<\/a> would then be lovely! Change logs get shared there and on <a href=\"https:\/\/forums.bohemia.net\/forums\/topic\/160288-arma-3-stable-server-210-performance-binary-feedback\/\" target=\"\">the forums<\/a>.<\/li><li><i>Release Candidate Branch<\/i>: or RC Branch is only available in the weeks leading up to a platform update. It is our full snapshot build that we hope to release to everyone later, but may still receive a few fixes as we test it. Intel on these is always shared via our channels. This one is for those wanting a peek at the future or wanting to help us make the update as solid as possible. Thanks to all who've helped out in the past!<br><\/li><\/ul><p>While it's hard to confirm right now, we believe our next release for Arma 3 will be its <b>Licensed Data Packages<\/b>.&nbsp;Just like with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bohemia.net\/community\/licenses\/licensed-data-packages\" target=\"\">LDPs for previous Arma titles<\/a>, they should allow modders to use some of the vanilla data under license, also in future Arma games. Plans for platform <b>update 2.12<\/b> are still in the works, but we believe it will probably come your way in early 2023. We don't yet have concrete additions determined for it, but a lot of this has recently been community-driven, via <a href=\"https:\/\/feedback.bistudio.com\/project\/view\/1\/\" target=\"\">Feedback Tracker<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/discord.com\/invite\/arma\" target=\"\">Discord<\/a>. That does not mean we can accommodate all requests, in fact many are just not feasible anymore. But it can't hurt to ask, right? If you're interested in this development, you can always keep track of the experimental testing branches we mentioned earlier. Last time, we also mentioned looking for ways for more community involvement in further platform development. That has not yet progressed in significant ways, although we still see it as being part of the next phase, whenever it may start. Some community devs have already reached out to us with their interest. If you have ideas, do let us know.<br><\/p><p>Besides development itself, also keep an eye on our channels for upcoming activities organized by our Community Manager <i><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jtleclair\" target=\"\">Justin LeClair<\/a><\/i> and the Publishing teams. Justin has been hosting several in-depth livestreams together with various milsim groups. More streams of various types are being planned. We'll also continue regular series like Community Radars, and perhaps revive a few classics. It's an absolute privilege to see your stunning screenshots, inspiring videos, and other creations. Keep them coming and we'll try to signal boost what we can.<br><\/p><p><br><\/p><h2>LOGISTICS<br><\/h2><p>A while ago, we were invited by the <b><i><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/I_W_M\/status\/1536997714990231552\" target=\"\">Imperial War Museum<\/a><\/i><\/b> in London to participate in an exhibit about what video games can tell us about armed conflict. Titled <i><a href=\"https:\/\/www.iwm.org.uk\/events\/war-games\" target=\"\">\"War Games: Real Conflicts | Virtual Worlds | Extreme Entertainment\"<\/a><\/i>, Arma 3 will be one of titles on display.

It suits recon patrol operations on foot, with many hidden jungle caches, caves, POW camps and a tunnel system.<\/p> <p>To get you started we have included 4 new Zeus missions and separately released an updated Mike Force mission on Steam for it.<br><\/p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/vn_img_23_oprep.png\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/vn_img_23_oprep.png\" class=\"img-responsive\" height=\"\" width=\"\"><\/a><\/p> <h2>A BIGGER WAR<br><\/h2> <p>The war in Southeast Asia was a coalition war - between many nations on each side.

There are also new <b>CIA<\/b> and <b>ARVN Marines<\/b> units.<\/p> <p>Each faction is equipped with new custom weapons, equipment and vehicles, and an <b>ambient voice pack<\/b> is included for both ANZAC nations. The new factions feature 400 new soldier classes, able to wear 20 new uniforms (with 65 variants), 14 vests, 5 packs (with 12 variants), 4 accessories and 11 new headgear items.<\/p> <p>Other factions have been upgraded, with new faces, weapons, headgear and camouflage patterns. The 4 MACV SOG team advisers we worked with now have their faces recreated in the game, along with new Montagnard and Vietnamese faces.<\/p> <p>For a neat overview of the Australian faction check out this community movie made by our Australian and Kiwi friends in XDF.

That is incredibly cool, but we can also imagine many have not read through old reports and do not know about our actual support plans. So let us take a look back at the major milestones during 2021, check in with the Live Ops crew, and explain our perspective on the future of Arma 3.

Large-scale development has ended, but a <b>small dedicated crew<\/b> still eagerly tries to improve and expand the core platform. And we might even conclude their great work has exceeded even our own expectations for this stage of the game's life. This small team includes two very effective programmers known to many in the community, who are now the primary developers still spending most of their time in Real Virtuality's codebase. They are supported by embedded QA testers, who are in turn backed up by our on-demand Publishing QA army. Then there's our mastering and deployment engineer, and finally yours truly as coordinator. But we'd have to also mention many other Bohemians in various roles, who are still involved for any given amount of time. Plus, we should of course not forget a dedicated group of people focused on Creator DLC, as well as our brand and community managers. In the <b>community<\/b> too, there are people who have been incredibly supportive. Our thanks go to those heroes who help us document new changes, test complex issues, give early warnings of compatibility problems, moderate conversations, and do much more. Especially those people active on <a href=\"https:\/\/discord.gg\/arma\" target=\"\">Discord<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/feedback.bistudio.com\/\" target=\"\">Feedback Tracker<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Main_Page\" target=\"\">Community Wiki<\/a> and the <a href=\"https:\/\/forums.bohemia.net\/forums\/forum\/218-arma-3\/\" target=\"\">forums<\/a> have helped out a lot (<i>Lou Montana<\/i>, <i>R3vo<\/i> and <i>Leopard20<\/i> just to name a few). So, while the core team is certainly much smaller than it has been years ago, there's still plenty of our work going into this long-lasting Arma 3 adventure!<br><\/p><p>In previous reports we've explained that <b>the scope and nature of the changes still feasible to do is limited<\/b>. Besides simply our available resources for development and testing, a huge factor is <b>backwards-compatibility<\/b>. Doing deep and large changes to the behavior of systems, mechanics, or even single script commands tends to break our own vanilla content as well as the enormous user-generated content library out there. Ironically, we know about certain bugs that could be fixed, but cannot because of this reason. We know of some smaller optimization opportunities, which are also too risky now. Having said that, it's still very cool to see what especially <i><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/dedmenmiller\" target=\"\">Dedmen<\/a><\/i> and <i><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Killzone_Kid\" target=\"\">Killzone Kid<\/a><\/i> have been able to do recently. By being active within the community, looking at various feedback channels, and having their own wishes, they have delivered some long-time requested work. Those range from script commands to Event Handlers, fixes to modest optimizations, and more. We've also recently become a bit more flexible by adding limited engine support for 'features' that are mostly aimed at mod creators. In some cases such additions even have accepted limitations, such as not working well in all contexts. These features will not be converted to vanilla game mechanics, but can still be very powerful for all players. You'll read about some examples later on.<br><\/p><p>Even though limited, these changes bring with them risks that we cannot entirely eliminate. There will be cases where even after our dedicated testing processes and public <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/dev-branch\" target=\"\">Dev-Branch<\/a> \/ <a href=\"https:\/\/forums.bohemia.net\/forums\/topic\/160288-arma-3-stable-server-204-performance-binary-feedback\/\" target=\"\">Profiling Branch<\/a> \/ <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/rc-branch\" target=\"\">RC-Branch<\/a> testing, some things break after release 'in the wild.' We will try to monitor carefully and hotfix new issues as fast as possible, but we are not the big development machine we once were. Ultimately, we do still believe the additions are worth the risks in the long term, so please be patient with us.<br><\/p><p><br><\/p><p>OK, that brings us to back to the previous main branch <b>updates <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/post\/spotrep-00096\" target=\"\">2.02<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/post\/spotrep-00098\" target=\"\">2.04<\/a><\/b>. They have been out for a while, but we still wanted to highlight a few cool additions for creators. Scripts can now use a new engine data structure that contains key-value pairs via <b><a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/HashMap\" target=\"\">HashMaps<\/a><\/b>. You may know such structures from other languages and can potentially still replace and optimize certain scripts to be faster and better organized. Another popular addition has been the <b><a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/setObjectScale\" target=\"\">setObjectScale<\/a><\/b> script command, which allows shrinking and growing most objects as implied. This is one of those additions which simply will break the game when used in extreme ways, but it's already shown to provide <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/dedmenmiller\/status\/1333785837205483524\" target=\"\">great fun<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Greenfist3000\/status\/1358479428981035013\" target=\"\">impressive artwork<\/a>. In a similar vein, it is now possible to let objects following the rotation of memory points or bones via a new <a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/attachTo\" target=\"\">attachTo<\/a> parameter. UI creators may enjoy the new <b><a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/import\" target=\"\">import<\/a><\/b> directive, letting you <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Killzone_Kid\/status\/1294689982628671488\" target=\"\">re-use configurations<\/a> from the core game in a scenario of your own. For advanced mod teams, we've introduced a method to pre-compile SQF scripts and to store the resulting <b>bytecode SQFC<\/b> files in addons. It allows heavily scripted mods to shorten their start-up time and load faster. Several popular mods, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=450814997\" target=\"\">CBA<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=463939057\" target=\"\">ACE<\/a>, already use this in their latest releases. We may still do so also for (parts of) our vanilla Functions Library, but that's not yet confirmed.<\/p><p><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\"><div class=\"center-block\" style=\"max-width: 400px\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/dedmenmiller\/status\/1333785837205483524\"><\/a><\/blockquote><\/div><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\"><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\"><div class=\"center-block\" style=\"max-width: 400px\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Killzone_Kid\/status\/1294689982628671488\"><\/a><\/blockquote><\/div><\/p><p><br><\/p><p>Nearly there, we have arrived to our current focus: <b>update 2.06<\/b>. Already undergoing public <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Arma3official\/status\/1427645921224019979\" target=\"\">Release Candidate testing<\/a>, this platform update should hit main branch during the next few weeks. And it's another feisty one! Players will be happy to experience <b>new video options<\/b> that allow a bit more control over the performance-demanding <b>Picture-in-Picture<\/b> rendering. We've also added <b>volumetric weapon flashlight cones<\/b> to make them more consistent with vehicle headlights. On the topic of lights, mod makers may appreciate having <b>extended control over InfraRed light sources<\/b>. This can open the door to some cool new weapon attachments for example. This is another one of those additions that will not be used to add vanilla assets at this late stage, but we still think can be very useful to scripters and modders. Similarly, there will be introduced <b>scripted support for vehicle speed limiters, cruise control, and simple towing<\/b>. We can imagine very cool custom creations with those, but we want to again be clear that this will not translate to vanilla game mechanics anymore.<br><\/p><p><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\"><div class=\"center-block\" style=\"max-width: 400px\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Arma3official\/status\/1427645921224019979\"><\/a><\/blockquote><\/div><\/p><p>There are three further big highlights. For many years, mods have had to rely on 'hacks' to add custom keybindings for their new mechanics. This update will allow them to implement special <b><a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Arma_3:_Modded_Keybinding\" target=\"\">modded keybindings<\/a><\/b> that more closely resemble the primary game controls. For players that means they can also be easily configured in the controls options. Scenario creators will find some extra functionality to <b>place almost any type of object as <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/dedmenmiller\/status\/1420661067647234059\" target=\"\">Vehicle-in-Vehicle cargo<\/a> in Eden Editor<\/b> now. The cherry on the virtual cake is the new ability to <b>place Eden Editor object compositions directly via Zeus<\/b>, both custom ones and those from Steam Workshop. This could make the divine lives of Game Masters quite a lot easier. Please note that by default you can hold modifier key Ctrl to follow the terrain or Alt to place the composition at its original position. All in all, this update is looking to be a nice one we hope you'll enjoy!<br><\/p><p><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\"><div class=\"center-block\" style=\"max-width: 400px\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/dedmenmiller\/status\/1420661067647234059\"><\/a><\/blockquote><\/div><\/p><p><br><\/p><p>Looking towards the <b>future<\/b>, we have some ideas of where we want to take Arma 3 Live Ops next. The game is still strong and played by many, so we like being in a position to support it yet longer. That said, we cannot confirm what the next years will look like precisely, and Bohemia Interactive priorities may need us elsewhere. For now, we'll continue with platform updates at the current relatively slow pace. We'll still try to push out Dev-Branch updates every week, but it may easily become less frequent. Profiling Branch has also become more automated and is a good opportunity for certain types of changes to be tested publicly. And there are still Creator DLC in the pipeline that we will share more information about when they can be confirmed by us and the third-party creator teams.<br><\/p><p>Beyond that, we are exploring ways of enabling more <b>community involvement<\/b> in the further development of the platform. This may start with engaging a few more experienced community developers via external contracting and merging selected contributions to future updates. But we are also interested in ways of more direct participation, such as perhaps via platforms like GitHub. That may begin with small parts of the game, like the scripted Functions Library, but maybe there are ways to go even further over the coming years. A tricky part is to keep the main game stable enough for the entire playerbase. Properly coordinating and testing many contributions can also be quite time-consuming. One potential idea would be the launch of a special 'Community Branch' on Steam, which might be accepted to be more experimental. We may reach out to community developers for their input and will let you know when such efforts start happening. There's no reason for Arma 3 to not continue getting better!<br><\/p><p><br><\/p><h2>LOGISTICS<br><\/h2><p>You probably thought that was it? But we still have some reminders that are less directly about the game. In case you did not know, we freely publish separate apps for <b>Arma 3's <a href=\"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/233800\/\" target=\"\">Tools<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/390500\/\" target=\"\">Samples<\/a><\/b>. These have also seen <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/techrep\" target=\"\">several smaller updates<\/a> this year, primarily to add support for the new Art of War DLC and various Creator DLC. Additionally, they updated specific tools with support for SQF Bytecode and new <a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/PreProcessor_Commands\" target=\"\">preprocessor macros<\/a> for config files.<br><\/p><p><br><\/p><p>Some eagle-eyed players may have noticed that we've had to 'enable' <b>Steam Cloud<\/b> for Arma 3 a while ago. That was unfortunately caused by a Steam client update, which otherwise would break our Steam Workshop publication (from Eden Editor f.e.). Even after communication with Valve, this was determined as a final state. The downside is that Arma 3 does not actually support Steam Cloud features, such as cloud saved games. We've even investigated whether that might be something to add, but it's highly complex due to the game's approach to profiles and the size of user data. All that is to say that while your Steam client may claim full support, it unfortunately does not and will not.<br><\/p><p><br><\/p><p>That leaves us with one last reminder for server administrators. Back in version 2.04 we've updated the Steam client libraries, which now support an <b><a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/discussions\/forum\/14\/2974028351344359625\/\" target=\"\">opt-in security enhancement<\/a> for servers against DDoS attacks<\/b>. It's important to note that this indeed needs to be configured and enabled on the server-side and is not active by default.

The reason for the long delays was the sheer complexity of such a system and the near-endless possibility for such a device to cause unwanted behavior and issues, especially in a Multiplayer environment. However, we have finally refined it and reworked so much that we are now confident to release it. This is a great relief to us, since the Weferlingen terrain was made specifically for bridge layers in operations (Weferlingen’s rivers have the fitting width and of course all our road bridges can be destroyed, too) and now they can be deployed to increase the mobility of mechanized assaults and supply routes. Both West Germany and Denmark use the BrPz 1. <\/p> <p><div class=\"img-wrapper\"><a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/arma3_creatordlc_gm_update1_4_screenshot_08.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/arma3_creatordlc_gm_update1_4_screenshot_08.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\" height=\"\" width=\"\"><\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/arma3_creatordlc_gm_update1_4_screenshot_06.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/arma3_creatordlc_gm_update1_4_screenshot_06.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\" height=\"\" width=\"\"><\/a><\/div><br><\/p> <h4>New Co-Op Scenario<\/h4> <p> Also part of this update is a new multiplayer co-op scenario called “Ninjas.” In this mission, 2-4 players are tasked with preventing waves of enemy forces advancing further into West Germany.

It is the ideal choice for mechanized warfare due to high cross-country mobility and enough front armor protection to stop enemy 20mm Armor Piercing rounds. <\/p> <p>The SPz 1 is introduced in 3 different versions:<\/p> <ul> <li> SPz 1A1A with no night fighting capabilities but a rear-facing MG3 turret operated by the squad leader inside the rear cargo compartment. <\/li> <li>The SPz 1A1+ is an upgraded SPz 1A1A with very basic night fighting capabilities.<\/li> <li> The SPz 1A2 had it’s rear-facing MG3 turret removed but gained a sophisticated Thermal Imaging system instead, making this variant a significant modernization of the SPz 1. <\/li> <\/ul> <p><div class=\"img-wrapper\"><a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/cdlc_gm_13_1.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/cdlc_gm_13_1.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\" height=\"\" width=\"\"><\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/cdlc_gm_13_2.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/cdlc_gm_13_2.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\" height=\"\" width=\"\"><\/a><\/div><\/p> <ul><\/ul> <h4><strong>UAZ 469<\/strong> <br><\/h4> <p> Originally made in the Soviet Union this vehicle is a rugged, reliable and iconic piece of cold-war tech that found its way into GM. Here it will improve the mobility of light infantry patrols and aid paratroopers with highly mobile (and deadly) anti-tank capabilities. <\/p> <p> You will find it is available as a regular cargo variant big enough to carry up to 6 additional passengers next to a driver, as paratrooper’s anti-tank support vehicle with a special East-German mount for the SPG-9 recoilless gun and also as a patrol car with the heavy DShKM mounted. Yes we know this HMG-equipped UAZ version was not fielded by East Germany, but we’ve decided to still add it for gameplay reasons since we simply couldn’t pass such a variant over. <\/p> <p> Both the SPG-9 and DShKM are now also available on a tripod in the static weapons category for East German and Polish forces. <\/p> <p><div class=\"img-wrapper\"><a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/cdlc_gm_13_3.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/cdlc_gm_13_3.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\" height=\"\" width=\"\"><\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/cdlc_gm_13_4.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/cdlc_gm_13_4.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\" height=\"\" width=\"\"><\/a><\/div><\/p> <h4><strong>West Germany 1990’s<\/strong> <br><\/h4> <p> There is a burning desire within the community to see the addition of 1990s West German forces. We can finally reveal that this did not fall on deaf ears and we are now introducing the famous “Flecktarn” uniforms, together with a more adequate Panzerfaust 3 Anti-Tank weapon and everyone’s favourite “plastic rifle”: the G36. <\/p> <p> While the focus of Global Mobilization - Cold War Germany of course lies with the titular Cold War, we felt comfortable enough to push the timeframe to include this 1990s expansion. The technology and uniforms introduced in the 1990s were developed and extensively trialled during the 1980s in preparation for a new generation of conflict with the East. So for us that made it a good fit and a logical step to take to integrate into the project.<br><br>GM’s campaign and missions will of course remain firmly rooted in the early eighties. <br> <\/p> <p><div class=\"img-wrapper\"><a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/cdlc_gm_13_5.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/cdlc_gm_13_5.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\" height=\"\" width=\"\"><\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/cdlc_gm_13_6.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/cdlc_gm_13_6.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\" height=\"\" width=\"\"><\/a><\/div><\/p> <p> Regarding those missions:<br>We’ve taken the campaign’s last mission, “Republikflucht” (which is a more open world type “Escape and Evade” type scenario) and made it directly available from the Singleplayer Scenarios screen. It is still part of the campaign, so this is just an additional way of starting that mission without requiring a completion of “State Scarlet”.<br>The Community’s reaction to “Republikflucht” was very positive due to the unique setting and replayability, so we wanted to make it more accessible to everyone. Good luck out there! <\/p> <h4><strong>Smaller Extras<\/strong><\/h4> <p> With the addition of the Granatpistole for West Germany and the Pallad grenade launchers (Both handheld and underslung) for Poland you are now given the ability to send 40mm grenades over greater distances. This augments the G3’s rifle grenades quite well. Check them out if you haven’t already. <br> <\/p> <p> Speaking of convenient Anti Tank capabilities: The Danish have received their M72A3 LAW. While it has a very low-end armor-penetration power it does make itself very attractive through a very compact size and low weight that will not affect your endurance by much. <\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/cdlc_gm_13_7.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/cdlc_gm_13_7.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\" height=\"\" width=\"\"><\/a><\/p> <h4><strong>Plain Sight<\/strong><\/h4> <p> An allround update was given to all of GM’s combat vehicles.

Offering a distraction from the frequently grim reality around us, gaming has certainly seen a massive boost this year. Arma 3 is no exception. We are constantly humbled to see how many of you continue to play, and to welcome the hundreds of thousands of new recruits. The game is meanwhile in a Live Ops mode, rather than active development. Even so, this year saw two primary platform updates with 1.98 Old Man and more recently 2.00, on which we'll reflect a bit in this report. And we'll be looking ahead, providing updates on what's still to come: <b>Art of War charity DLC<\/b>, <b>Creator DLC<\/b>, and more <b>platform support<\/b>. We suspect to be seeing plenty of comments asking about the future of the Arma series, but we hope there are still many of you interested to learn about <b>Arma 3<\/b>'s extended tour of duty. Thank you for the splendid support and stay safe out there! o7<br><\/p><p><br><\/p><h2>INTELLIGENCE<br><\/h2><p>Early in the year, we released the open-world <b><a href=\"https:\/\/arma3.com\/news\/arma-3-apex-old-man-is-now-available\" target=\"\">\"Old Man\" scenario<\/a><\/b>. Its more experimental exploration of freedom in gameplay was received well by many players. Though we could not afford to support it with major updates, one of its designers did <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Arma3official\/status\/1290285682879918082\" target=\"\">publish<\/a> a retrospective as <b>OP<\/b>erations <b>REP<\/b>ort. We recommend reading this behind-the-scenes peek by <i><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/SgS_Sarge\" target=\"\">Václav 'Sarge' Kerber<\/a><\/i>, which goes over the systemic approach to populating the world, catering to parallel work within the team, and quest design to name a few things. To cap it off, Sarge also posted <b>documentation to <a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Arma_3_Old_Man_Systems\" target=\"\">Community Wiki<\/a><\/b> on how the main Old Man systems and modules work. While these were only created for the singleplayer environment, there is a big potential for you to build a similar scenario on its framework.<br><\/p><p><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\"><div class=\"center-block\" style=\"max-width: 400px\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Arma3official\/status\/1290285682879918082\"><\/a><\/blockquote><\/div><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\"><br><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\">After the 1.98 Old Man release, we knew that <b><a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/post\/spotrep-00095\" target=\"\">update 2.00<\/a><\/b> would naturally follow. Many years ago we devised a versioning system that we believed would be quite future-proof. Even versions were main branch releases, whereas odd versions were reserved for our <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/dev-branch\" target=\"\">Dev(elopment) Branch<\/a> (needing to be different to deliberately make them multiplayer incompatible). Little did we know that Arma 3 would still be updated so many years later. On top of that, this version was slated to be a fairly standard maintenance update on our roadmap. We wanted at least to try to make it a little bit more special, and so went around to see what we could achieve with our really rather small Live Ops team.<br><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\"><div class=\"video-wrapper\" id=\"ElxZ8ePBLPs\"><div class=\"absolute-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ElxZ8ePBLPs\" data-video=\"ElxZ8ePBLPs\" data-container=\".video-wrapper#ElxZ8ePBLPs\" data-removeitem=\".video-wrapper#ElxZ8ePBLPs .btn\" class=\"btn btn-play\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-play\"><\/span><\/a><\/div><img src=\"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/ElxZ8ePBLPs\/maxresdefault.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"><\/div><br><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\">Ultimately we built a modest <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ElxZ8ePBLPs\" target=\"\">package<\/a> of free additions and improvements. Included were a new CoF: Gray Firing Drill, a few reskins, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-R7q2XsGIgs\" target=\"\">\"Arma\" Eau de Combat<\/a> fragrance finally brought 'alive', the ability to publish Eden Editor compositions to Steam Workshop, Linux 64-bit Dedicated Servers, Steam Achievements, script commands, and the usual fixes. We know some of you wanted more or different things, but we're still very happy to have been able to support the game and community in this way. Doing so this long after a game's release is not always possible; it may even be an exception in the market. And it's great that the support of the game and its modding has made such longevity possible.<br><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\">With <b>CoF: Gray<\/b>, there is more than meets the eye. Those replaying the drill a few times, may have uncovered its many little secrets and hommages to literally all main releases so far. Pay special attention to the so-called 'Binary Jukebox' towards the end. It became a celebration of the Armaverse that some fans may enjoy. We'd also like to thank community top shot <i><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/KnoWhatCeb\" target=\"\">Ceb.Cin<\/a><\/i> for the excellent pre-release testing and feedback. That <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=D5VaowYpQKQ\" target=\"\">01:07 benchmark run<\/a> was quite something! And since an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=cUijeKcvmmY\" target=\"\">even better time<\/a> was uploaded recently, we probably should ask Miller to update his whiteboard.

In fact, the original team behind Eden Editor had already prepared parts of the architecture for it. They unfortunately had no time to wrap it up, but we were finally able to do so. Thanks to Senior Programmer <i>Lukáš Gregor<\/i>, building on the work of <i><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/KarelMoricky\" target=\"\">Karel Mořický<\/a><\/i> and <i>Filip Sádovský<\/i>, you can now share your creations with everyone.

The feature has also been <b>documented on the <a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Eden_Editor:_Custom_Composition\" target=\"\">Community Wiki<\/a><\/b>, and we'd like to draw your attention to the <b>'vertical mode' setting<\/b> especially. Perhaps you've already encountered placing subscribed compositions and having certain objects float in the air. This can likely be prevented by toggling the appropriate vertical mode (or surface snapping) toggle in Eden Editor. A common situation where this is the case: objects stood on a table. We may still find a nicer way to address this, but so far have opted to preserve full designer freedom.<\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\"><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\"><div class=\"center-block\" style=\"max-width: 400px\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/maruksp\/status\/1324853762457018369\"><\/a><\/blockquote><\/div><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\">Topping things off in update 2.00 are 3 cheeky new <b><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Zadra66\/status\/1313627839728693254\" target=\"\">Steam Achievements<\/a><\/b>. Besides beating the gold medal (faster than 02:00) in CoF: Gray, you will unlock <i>This is War 2.00<\/i> by just playing the game after the 2.00 update. And so far well over half a million players did, which just shows again how many individuals still or freshly jump in! The last Achievement created a little bit of confusion, so let's clarify what it requires. You need to have actually played the game for over 200 hours (see a pattern here?). Playing truly means 'boots on the ground' playing, so not even menus (including the Eden Editor interface) count. Do not look at your Steam 'playtime' for this, because it counts all time the application is running. Still, there are close to 200 thousand players having unlocked this so far, splendid Loyalists!<br><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\"><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\"><div class=\"center-block\" style=\"max-width: 400px\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Zadra66\/status\/1313627839728693254\"><\/a><\/blockquote><\/div><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\"><br><\/p><h2>OPERATIONS<br><\/h2><p class=\"twitter-embed\">Now then, let us take a look at what's next.

We did however send some selected entrants a participation prize, and hope to have found some other subtle ways to still recognize their efforts in the DLC Showcases. Due to this, we also decided to buff the DLC a bit ourselves with some extra assets befitting the themes. Being created in-house by Bohemia Interactive artists, this has taken a little bit longer than our original schedule catered for. For that reason we'll be <b>shifting the release to early 2021<\/b>, to ensure we can wrap up the package in the best way. We do think this will be worth it for the benefits to the platform. Remember that all of our revenue from this DLC will be donated to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.icrc.org\/\" target=\"\">International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)<\/a>, and that after a fundraising period of about 10-12 months (also shifted), it will become free to all players.

Developed by third-party <i><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/cslastudio\" target=\"\">CSLA Studio<\/a><\/i> and published by us, this DLC takes players back to an alternate version of the Cold War in 1980s Czechoslovakia. Immediately following the announcement, an invitation-only closed beta test was organized to receive feedback on the project. CSLA Studio invited various members of their own community as did we. We would like to thank everybody involved for their honest and constructive feedback. After evaluating the results of this test and discussing them with CSLA Studio, the decision was made to give the DLC more time in its development phase. Everybody is excited to deliver the best possible experience and so the team will take some more time to polish their content. This means the DLC is now <b>targeting a release in 2021<\/b>, but we will rather provide more concrete timelines and pricing details next year. For more information about the Creator DLC program, check out <a href=\"https:\/\/arma3.com\/dlc\/creator\" target=\"\">this page<\/a>.<br><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\"><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\"><div class=\"center-block\" style=\"max-width: 400px\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Arma3official\/status\/1308390977053351936\"><\/a><\/blockquote><\/div><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\"><br><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\">After several requests from the community, we have finally published <b><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Arma3official\/status\/1329096001941082115\" target=\"\">documentation and guides<\/a><\/b> on how to create your own <b>Challenges (<a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Arma_3_Firing_Drills\" target=\"\">Firing Drills<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Arma_3_Time_Trials\" target=\"\">Time Trials<\/a>)<\/b>.

Once subscribed, these will also appear in the correct menu and show personal best times.

We refer you to a <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/post\/sitrep-00237\" target=\"\">previous report<\/a> in which we detailed this. Having said that, we are happy that a few of us are still able to push out fixes and improvements, while the majority of Bohemian developers are focused on our future Enfusion-based projects. The primary people in this Live Ops team do also fluctuate. We are saying goodbye to Associate Producer <i>Radek Pazdera<\/i>, who has supported Mastering, Deployment, and coordination tremendously over the past years. Thank you for your hard work, Radek! o7<br><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\">At the same time we are also seeing some modest extra reinforcements. Previously externally contracted programmer <i><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/dedmenmiller\" target=\"\">Dedmen<\/a><\/i>, now supports Arma 3 full-time from our Amsterdam studio. And <i><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Killzone_Kid\" target=\"\">Killzone Kid<\/a><\/i> is also still doing cool additions in support of the community. Of the Bohemians who still spend quite some time on the game's development, we want to put the spotlight on <i>Maciej 'Reyhard' Pham<\/i>, our Technical Designer who is often going out of his way to help out. And of course we cannot forget our QA Tester <i>Miloš 'Wulf' Miko<\/i>, who frequently takes on the daunting task of testing this incredibly massive and complex game. We are also recruiting a <b><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Arma3official\/status\/1318950170667646983\" target=\"\">new Live Ops Engineer<\/a><\/b> in Amsterdam to take over Radek's duties, and to generally still optimize some of the pipelines. If you are interested in supporting the game and platform, be sure to check out the job listing and apply!<br><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\"><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\"><div class=\"center-block\" style=\"max-width: 400px\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Arma3official\/status\/1318950170667646983\"><\/a><\/blockquote><\/div><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\">The result of having this modest Live Ops crew available, is that in 2021 we still want to do our best to support Arma 3. That of course means the Art of War DLC release and enabling various Creator DLC to get ready for their releases. In addition, we will continue to add new script commands, Event Handlers, optimizations where possible. Dedmen, for example, has various promising start-up time boosts in the pipeline for 2.02&nbsp;and beyond, some of which are already in testing via the experimental <a href=\"https:\/\/forums.bohemia.net\/forums\/topic\/160288-arma-3-stable-server-200-performance-binary-feedback\/\" target=\"\">Profiling Branch<\/a>. Don't expect massive 'magic bullet' gains though; we are still limited by the underlying technologies and backward compatibility. Another goal we've had on our backlog for long is the publication of Arma 3 Licensed Data Packages. This too is something we want to target next year.<br><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\"><br><\/p><h2>LOGISTICS<br><\/h2><p class=\"twitter-embed\">As we're getting to the end of this report, we'd like to remind you of another release that happened hot on the heels of the <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/post\/sitrep-00238\" target=\"\">previous SITREP<\/a>. <b><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Arma3official\/status\/1275423306750013441\" target=\"\">Creator DLC: Global Mobilization - Cold War<\/a><\/b> published their <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Arma3official\/status\/1275422302717521922\" target=\"\">update 1.2<\/a> last summer.

During the development of <a href=\"https:\/\/arma3.com\/news\/arma-3-apex-old-man-is-now-available\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Arma 3 Apex: Old Man<\/a>, I worked as a quest designer, responsible for the story and the scenario's general flow. I'd like to share with you what I learned on the project, including some of the daily challenges we faced and the ultimate goals behind our 'what if' approach to open world quest design. <\/p> <h3>SYSTEMS MAKES LIFE EASIER<\/h3> <p> So, I guess I'll just jump right in. The first problem we faced was performance. Although Arma 3 has been with us for more than 6 years, we very quickly discovered that it was simply not feasible to populate a large terrain such as Tanoa with nice, detailed compositions and realistic looking ambient life. At least not without some spawning \/ despawning system. Also, working on one scenario simultaneously with a group of fellow Bohemians posed issues of its own, on account of dependencies and conflicts in our data. Because of that, we developed a number of systems to make our lives easier. <\/p> <h4>Populating the world<\/h4> <p> First, I want to talk about what we called 'sectors'. A designer working on a mission can place a module to handle the behavior of units and objects placed in its range, or in a defined layer. The spawn distances for objects and vehicles can also be selected. Furthermore, a different spawn distance can be selected in an aircraft, because - let's face it - we don't really care too much about objects in a tent when we're cruising in an airplane at 20,000 feet. But we do care about AA batteries guarding a military base, for example. Many additional parameters can be set as well, such as which side a sector belongs to (e.g., CSAT or L'Ensemble) or whether or not a sector is restricted (e.g., a military base). And that's just to name a few things. <br> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/oprep_oldman_1.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/oprep_oldman_1.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\" height=\"\" width=\"\"><\/a> <i>Here you can see how we were able to populate large areas with detailed compositions. This wouldn't be possible without our new modules, called 'sectors'.<\/i> <\/p> <h4>Parallel work<\/h4> <p> The next system I want to mention relates to the ability to export and later include more missions into the main one - something that helped streamline mission design. Old Man consists of over 50 missions. In the end, we sorted these based on locations, sides, and quests. Some specific systems like those involving hostels and caches also have their own dedicated mission file. <br> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/oprep_oldman_2.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/oprep_oldman_2.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\" height=\"\" width=\"\"><\/a> <i>As you can see here, Old Man contains a lot of separate missions.<\/i> <br> These systems were designed to work independently, in keeping with our general design vision. That gave us two major benefits. The world of Old Man is not player-centric. For example, you can witness a random gunfight between L'Ensemble insurgents and a CSAT patrol. If they suffer heavy losses, they'll call a Quick Reaction Force (QRF) to help them out, no matter if the player is involved in this fight or not. The second advantage is when something in one system or quest goes wrong, it doesn't break the whole scenario. <\/p> <h3>OPEN WORLD QUESTS<\/h3> <p> Regarding quests, or \"super quests\" as we came to call them (several tasks with one overarching goal), these presented a unique design problem and really forced us to think outside the box. With Old Man, we decided to choose an approach where the player can go wherever they want and do whatever they want. There are no restrictions or limitations. All NPCs in the world can be killed and the scenario should still continue. There's no such thing as a traditional 'game over'. All quests (if it makes sense) can be finished without being actively assigned, and if the result should have some meaningful impact, it will. <br> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/oprep_oldman_3.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/oprep_oldman_3.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\" height=\"\" width=\"\"><\/a> <i>An FSM, or Finite State Machine, showing the flow in one of our \"super quests\".<\/i> <\/p> <h4>Flow example<\/h4> <p><i>Note: minor potential spoilers ahead!<\/i><\/p> <p> Let's take a case in point, drawing on an example from very early on in the game. It's morning; you wake up in your house and someone's knocking on the door. You open it and there's the local doctor, who you've recently met in Luganville. He reveals there's a group of sick civilians hiding in the jungle, in desperate need of medicine. He explains a meeting's been arranged with the notorious political group, L'Ensemble, at an abandoned warehouse. He is begging you to help him. So, you may say to yourself, 'why not', right? But then comes the question: 'what if'...? <\/p> <p> What if you robbed the doctor of his life the previous day? Maybe by accident, or maybe just because you wanted to see what would happen and how the scenario would react to it. Needless to say, if the doctor's fortunes took a turn for the worse, he won't be knocking on your door and the civilians he's been caring for, well, they're as good as dead now, too. But what then, if one of those civilians had a really important task for you? Take Howard, Tanoa's resident archaeologist, for instance. He had some hidden research papers and needed your help to fence them. Of course, they'll be pretty hard to find now. But you can still locate them in the world - and sell them for money! <\/p> <p> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/oprep_oldman_4.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/oprep_oldman_4.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\" height=\"\" width=\"\"><\/a> <i>Some compositions like this one in Luganville have multiple states and stages, based on the time of day and player's actions.<\/i> <\/p> <p> And what happens if the player isn't even at home? I mean, sure, our dialogue can be the same, but it's over the phone, and that demands a different opening. Now let's imagine the player hasn't been home, and instead had discovered the medicine the doctor needed while out exploring Tanoa. Does that mean we still need to meet the contact and secure the drugs? No, of course not - it wouldn't make much sense; we have to be able to hand them over right there and then. As you can see, these variables can mount up pretty quickly and things get very, very complicated. <\/p> <p> Put simply, we wanted to allow for contingencies, while avoiding dependencies. Our mission flow required us to be both dynamic and responsive in terms of design; important characters had to be expendable and any items in the world collectable. In fact, if you know what to do, you can even complete Old Man right from the get-go - there's nothing stopping you! You see, it was our intention to embrace as many options as possible, meaning there's no right or wrong way to play. <\/p> <h3>ALL FOR YOU<\/h3> <p> To be sure, there's a lot more we could talk about. For me personally, it's been an unexpected 2-year journey - full of learning and surprises. <\/p> <p> We developed a lot of systems to bring Old Man to life; some of them didn't make it into the game for release, others play a much smaller role than we had originally intended. But there are, at least, working modules handling faction relationships, spawning, quests, market economies, fast travel, checkpoints, intel objects, and more. All of these are tools you can play with in the Eden Editor and use for your own open world scenarios. <\/p> <p> You can find documentation for these systems on our <a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Arma_3_Old_Man_Systems\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Community Wiki<\/a>. <\/p> <p>I really look forward to seeing them in your creations!<\/p> <p> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/oprep_oldman_5.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/oprep_oldman_5.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\" height=\"\" width=\"\"><\/a><br><i>A colorful collage of post-it note pitches for Old Man's systems.<\/i> <\/p> <p>Sarge out.<\/p> <p> <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/SgS_Sarge\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Václav Kerber<\/a> <br> Designer <\/p> ","created_at":"2020-07-31 17:13:32","excerpt":"<p>Discussing the lessons learned from developing the Arma 3 Apex: Old Man scenario.<br><\/p>","id":426,"post_header_image":null,"post_thumb":null,"public_date":"2020-08-03 14:12:00","published":"1","title":"OPREP - OLD MAN","type":"oprep","updated_at":"2020-08-03 16:32:23","url":"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/post\/oprep-old-man"},{"animation_interval":200,"author":"Joris-Jan van 't Land","content":"<p>FROM: High Command <br>TO: Arma 3 Users<br>INFO: Art of War Announcement, Old Man Recap, Live Ops<br>PRECEDENCE: Flash<br><\/p><h2>SITUATION<br><\/h2><p>Now that we're publishing these reports less frequently, the amount of information we're collecting over the weeks is growing quite a bit.

Specifically in this case the most prominent issue was new technology that sought to prevent some cases of the infamous Arma Space Program for land vehicles (i.e. vehicles randomly flying a huge distance away after collisions). Unfortunately, some parts of this tech made the situation (and desync) worse and so were disabled in the hotfix. There are still some improvements enabled, which in combination with the PhysX library update itself, may work better in some situations. Another problem was connected to \"Old Man\" saves growing exorbitantly and then failing to load. Part of this was fixed at the source in the scenario itself, but only works when the scenario is fully restarted. There is also a more experimental fix available on <a href=\"https:\/\/forums.bohemia.net\/forums\/topic\/160288-arma-3-stable-server-194-performance-binary-feedback\/\" target=\"\">Profiling Branch<\/a> for those who have a save that cannot be loaded.

More details can be found on the <a href=\"https:\/\/schedule.gdconf.com\/session\/the-pandoras-box-of-modding-in-arma-games\/868734\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>GDC website<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p><p> <div class=\"center-block\" style=\"max-width: 400px\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/KarelMoricky\/status\/1217441215928508416\"><\/a><\/blockquote><\/div> <\/p><h3>OPERATIONS<\/h3> <p>Behind the scenes there have been quite some <strong>organizational changes<\/strong> for the Arma 3 project and Bohemia Interactive as a whole. As we've briefly eluded to in the <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/post\/sitrep-00236\" target=\"_blank\">previous report<\/a><\/strong>, the amount of development resources remaining for Arma 3 have been reduced a lot meanwhile. Many of our colleagues are working on Bohemia's future technology and games, so it's definitely for a good cause! At the same time Arma 3 is still actively played and extended by its passionate community. We want to do our best to support them as much as possible. Therefore a small <strong>Live Ops<\/strong> team is assigned to keep track of maintenance updates and of course launch support for upcoming <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/arma3.com\/dlc\/creator\" target=\"_blank\">Creator DLC<\/a><\/strong> (more news on those later this year). Instead of our own bigger additions, those DLC will actually be our main focus in 2020 and beyond. The team is also working closely with our Publishing colleagues to keep the game healthy.<\/p> <p>Arma 3 Live Ops sees the return of Project Lead <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/YorisYan\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Joris-Jan van 't Land<\/em><\/a><\/strong>, with most day-to-day coordination handled by Associate Producer <strong><em>Radek Pazdera<\/em><\/strong>. They are supported on-demand by Arma 3 veterans throughout the company, depending on their availability. We are also starting to look into other avenues for support work, such as by trialing external contract work with community programmers. This way there may yet be some limited development of the engine code for example. But please be aware that this will likely be scoped to simple new script commands and low-risk fixes. If we can figure out reliable workflows, it may however open things up for similar external contributions in the future. We would also like to very much thank those involved with running the Arma 3 project over the past years, and who have meanwhile moved on to other Bohemian projects or even new careers. Special kudos go to <strong><em><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ondrejkuzel\" target=\"_blank\">Ondřej Kužel<\/a><\/em><\/strong> and <strong><em>Bořivoj Klíma<\/em><\/strong>, who have actually managed many of the Live Ops activities during the past years.<\/p> <p>What does this all practically mean for Arma 3 development? Here are a few expected changes, most of which have been as such for some time:<\/p> <ul><li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/dev-branch\" target=\"_blank\">Dev-Branch<\/a><\/strong> updates are targeted to be weekly, but we will regularly skip a week in case there are no useful changes or there is a \"logistical issue\".<\/li><li>Main branch updates will be low in frequency, and only done when needed (for example to release a Creator DLC). These updates are a lot of work and there are many risks, but more on that later.<\/li><li>We mostly work on important fixes, security issues, third-party software changes, and similar. Don't expect big new features, technologies, nor large platform additions.<\/li><li>We'd like to publish more <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/390500\/Arma_3_Samples\/\" target=\"_blank\">Arma 3 samples<\/a><\/strong> and even <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bohemia.net\/community\/licenses\/licensed-data-packages\" target=\"_blank\">licensed data packages<\/a><\/strong> (as for previous Arma games), pending available resources to prepare them.<\/li><li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/sitrep\" target=\"_blank\">SITREPs<\/a><\/strong> will likely be infrequent, but on the other hand our Community Manager <strong><em><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Nillers_\" target=\"_blank\">Niles<\/a><\/em><\/strong> is keen to connect with you in other ways.<\/li><\/ul> <p>OK then, let's take a quick trip down memory lane, to last year's <strong>1.96 update<\/strong>. While the update required a hotfix – that we admit took too long to get done – it focused on bringing various parts of the Contact expansion over to the vanilla data, and miscellaneous fixes both to Contact itself and for the platform. Perhaps important to still highlight for community developers are two technical topics. We finally settled on a permanent warning-only status for undesired <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/waitUntil\" target=\"_blank\">waitUntil<\/a><\/strong> usage, instead of forcing it to break. Obviously it's still better to heed this warning and improve your scripts! And similarly, the behavior of <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/createVehicleLocal\" target=\"_blank\">createVehicleLocal<\/a><\/strong> is as it was before this update (but consider using <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/createSimpleObject\" target=\"_blank\">createSimpleObject<\/a><\/strong> with the 'local' parameter for a more future-proof implementation). Please see the SPOTREPs for the <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Arma3official\/status\/1189212659473891328\" target=\"_blank\">main release<\/a><\/strong> and <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Arma3official\/status\/1194638345118240769\" target=\"_blank\">hotfix<\/a><\/strong> for all details in case you missed them.<\/p> <p>That leads us to valid questions like: \"why can't you update the game without breaking it Bohemia?!\" Believe us, we are as upset when this happens as you are. We will always strive to avoid big issues and to make the game actually better with updates. Updating is however increasingly difficult given several natural consequences of the game's age and enormous scope. We could deep dive into why for many lengthy paragraphs, but the highlights are: the ever-expanding library of user-generated content means backward-compatibility is more and more rigid, and we simply have fewer in-house development resources as described above. That means many times a simple good fix or improvement has the tendency to break a mod or a scenario, no matter if it's actually better. Ironically when a bug or bad implementation lives on for too long, it becomes 'accepted' and worked into content. And we also cannot as quickly react to issues as back when we had around 80 experts assigned full-time. We still do use <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/dev-branch\" target=\"_blank\">Dev-Branch<\/a><\/strong> and <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/rc-branch\" target=\"_blank\">RC-Branch<\/a><\/strong>, but they have slowly lost much of their effectiveness due to a shrinking active audience (understandably). Often the issues don't appear in the vanilla game or even the most popular mods, but do pop up for private communities and deeply modded servers that we have trouble testing in-house. Ultimately, we have to be very careful and conservative in order to keep the platform stable for all. We'll keep trying to improve and to avoid issues or to solve them as swiftly as possible.<\/p> <p>On that note, we can't thank the community enough for still submitting reports on our <a href=\"https:\/\/feedback.bistudio.com\/project\/view\/1\/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Feedback Tracker<\/strong><\/a>. Your support in detailing tickets goes a long way in improving the quality and speed in which we can resolve issues with our games. Some even go above and beyond in this effort.

This scenario is currently in its beta version and can be found on the <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=1938939381\" target=\"_blank\">Steam Workshop<\/a><\/strong>. It is free for everyone, but it does require players to own the <a href=\"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/395180\/Arma_3_Apex\/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Arma 3 Apex<\/strong><\/a> expansion to play as it is located on the <a href=\"https:\/\/arma3.com\/tanoa\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Tanoa terrain<\/strong><\/a>. We decided to make this an optional download on the Steam Workshop so that users didn't need to switch to Dev-Branch to participate in its public beta testing. We've already received a ton of feedback that will go towards its next published updates. However, due to its experimental nature, the Old Man (Beta) was placed inside the <a href=\"https:\/\/incubator.bohemia.net\/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Bohemia Incubator<\/strong><\/a>. Depending on user feedback and available resources, the plan is to add the Old Man scenario to Arma 3 via a platform update in 2020. If that happens, people will still need to own the Arma 3 Apex expansion to play the scenario but no longer need to subscribe to the Workshop item.<\/p> <p> For all the details on the background of this scenario and how you can start playing, please head over to the <a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=1938939381\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Steam Workshop<\/strong><\/a>!

So to reinforce them, a range of new T-55 Main Battle Tanks will be made available:<\/p> <p><strong>T-55<\/strong> - Czechoslovak-built T-55 variant based on the T55A vehicle present in the first GM release in April, which was not entirely accurate. This T-55 is the baseline version, it features good all around protection and firepower, armed with the 100mm D10 gun, a coaxial SGMT as well as a driver operated bow-SGMT.<\/p> <p><strong>T-55A <\/strong> - Czechoslovak T-55A variant, GM is featuring a late version of the T-55A fitted with a DShKM anti aircraft Machine Gun to the loaders position. The coaxial SGMT is replaced by a PK machine gun. The driver SGMT is removed.<\/p> <p><strong>T-55AK <\/strong> - A Command version of the T-55A, capable of mounting a HTM10 telescopic antenna mast.<\/p> <p><strong>T-55AM2 <\/strong> - Czechoslovak version of the T-55AM, featuring the “Kladivo” fire control system with laser range finder, BDD addon armor on the upper front hull and turret, rubber side skirts for additional HEAT protection as well as a “Tucha” 8x 81mm smoke grenade launcher.<\/p> <p><strong>T-55AM2B <\/strong> - An additional upgrade to the T-55AM2, adding the capability to fire the “Bastion” anti tank guided missile. Enabling the T-55 to effectively engage targets at distances of up to 4000 meters.<\/p> <p> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/oprep_gm_wip_2.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/oprep_gm_wip_2.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\" height=\"\" width=\"\"><\/a> <\/p> <p> GM’s vehicles offer a lot of customization options, and this of course applies to the T-55. You’ll be able to choose from 16 toggleable extras and 6 different camo patterns to make sure no tank looks like another.<\/p> <p> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/oprep_gm_wip_3.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/oprep_gm_wip_3.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\" height=\"\" width=\"\"><\/a> <\/p> <p> Additionally, we’re looking to include the amphibious tank <strong>PT-76B<\/strong>.

So much, in fact, that they’ll start to become quite the heavy hitting specialists. The Danish infantry in GM was missing their vehicle of choice:<\/p> <p><strong>M113A1DK APC<\/strong> - The regular APC version of the M113A1 with Danish specific adjustments, visually the most obvious difference being the slightly different front and rear lights assembly. It is armed with the M2 cal .50 machinegun.<\/p> <p><strong>M113A1DK Engineering<\/strong> - A special variant of the M113A1DK designed for the support of an armored engineering group. It provides room for a group of soldiers and their engineering equipment. Visually identified by a ladder attached to the left side of the vehicle.<\/p> <p><strong>M113A1DK Command<\/strong> - A command version of the M113A1DK, visually identified by a power generator on top of the vehicle.<\/p> <p><strong>M113A1DK Medical <\/strong> - A medical version of the M113A1DK, capable of transporting up to 4 injured soldiers.<\/p> <p> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/oprep_gm_wip_6.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/oprep_gm_wip_6.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\" height=\"\" width=\"\"><\/a> <\/p> <p><strong>M113A2DK <\/strong>- To ramp up Denmark’s ante, the M113A2DK, known as the PMNK M\/92, will be included as well. This is a dedicated FSV (Fire Support Vehicle) based on the M113 armed with a 25mm autocannon. This will provide the firepower needed to square up against the East’s BMP-1.<\/p> <p> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/oprep_gm_wip_7.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/oprep_gm_wip_7.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\" height=\"\" width=\"\"><\/a> <\/p> <p> This is the content that we are confident about including in the planned 1.1 release this year.<\/p> <h3> LOOKOUT <\/h3> <p> We're also exploring a few other potential vehicle additions (including helicopters), but that's something that is yet to be officially confirmed.

So, let's take this opportunity to catch you up on all that happened since we've <b>released Contact expansion<\/b> about two months ago, and also take a look at what's coming up with update <b>1.96 and beyond<\/b>.<br><\/p><h3>INTELLIGENCE<\/h3><p>Although it's been a while, we will at least cover some of the highlights of the <b><a href=\"https:\/\/store.bistudio.com\/products\/arma3-contact\" target=\"_blank\">Arma 3 Contact<\/a><\/b> <b>release<\/b> and its rather huge associated <b><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Arma3official\/status\/1154441027022917638\" target=\"_blank\">1.94 platform update<\/a><\/b>. Celebrated by its <b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=xeyf4Xf0eYU\" target=\"_blank\">Launch Trailer<\/a><\/b>, first contact with extraterrestrial life was established on July 25, marking the culmination of a lot of hard work by various small teams in Bohemia. We've been going through all feedback received since day one, and were very happy to see the high praise for the unique experience and sandbox additions. Of course we also saw your criticism and took it to heart, while trying to address some points in post-release development (more in our 1.96 update intel later).<br><\/p><div class=\"video-wrapper\" id=\"xeyf4Xf0eYU\"><div class=\"absolute-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=xeyf4Xf0eYU\" data-video=\"xeyf4Xf0eYU\" data-container=\".video-wrapper#xeyf4Xf0eYU\" data-removeitem=\".video-wrapper#xeyf4Xf0eYU .btn\" class=\"btn btn-play\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-play\"><\/span><\/a><\/div><img src=\"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/xeyf4Xf0eYU\/maxresdefault.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"><\/div><p>Just to reiterate,&nbsp;we realize the <b>setup for Contact<\/b> with a <b>default part<\/b> (referred to as Contact Platform in the game) and <b>optional part<\/b> can be confusing. It allows for more flexibility, but is not always clear. The simplest way to look at it:<br><\/p><ul><li>For the singleplayer \"First Contact\" campaign (and Contact-specific user scenarios): <i>PLAY CONTACT<\/i> (or alternatively PLAY with Contact loaded or <i>-mod=Contact<\/i>)<br><\/li><li>For everything else, including Arma 3 sandbox multiplayer in Livonia and with the new weapons, vehicles, and other gear: <i>PLAY<\/i> (or alternatively <i>-mod=<\/i> or any configuration without loading Contact optionally)<br><\/li><\/ul><p>In the first weeks following the 1.94 release, it became apparent there was a significant issue with backward-compatibility of existing modded <a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Arma_3_Arsenal\" target=\"_blank\">Virtual Arsenal<\/a> load-outs. These are challenging problems, often appearing 'in the wild' when using large mod mixes or specific use cases, even after a long public Release Candidate process and our own tests with common mods. At this stage of Arma 3's life we don't actually want to make changes to these core systems and features, but sometimes it's necessary (for example to address a security issue or exploit). After some deliberation and testing, we ultimately reverted most of the behavior of Arsenal to its prior state to allow players to use their load-outs (at the cost of some smaller fixes). As a side benefit to publishing a <b><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Arma3official\/status\/1158689486680838149\" target=\"_blank\">hotfix to 1.94<\/a><\/b>, we did also manage to sneak in some first fixes to the \"First Contact\" campaign.<br><\/p><p>Wow, they sure grow up fast!

One part of this effort is slated for update 1.96 and can already be previewed on <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/dev-branch\" target=\"_blank\">Dev-Branch<\/a>. We've <b>moved<\/b> Contact's music, MOCAP animations, hand-written font, hand-drawn markers, Chemical Detector, CBRN overlays, and Spectrum Device over <b>to the platform component<\/b> (<i>enoch<\/i> data for those in the know). The devices will still not have out-of-the-box functionality and mainly work in the \"First Contact\" campaign, but at least the data will be available to everyone and can be referenced by community creators by their own scripts.<br><\/p><p>Let's take a look then, at the specific <b>documentation and samples<\/b> published so far (please note that some of this information could be considered a spoiler for the \"First Contact\" campaign):<br><\/p><ul><li><b>Alien Entity (AE) Behavior<\/b>: thanks to Technical Designer <i>Maciej Pham<\/i>, there is an <b><a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Arma_3_Alien_Entity_Behavior\" target=\"_blank\">extensive overview<\/a><\/b> of how the primary small AE can be controlled by scripting. He has also uploaded sample scenarios for a more <b><a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=1819778427\" target=\"_blank\">research-oriented AE<\/a><\/b> and <b><a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=1819779586\" target=\"_blank\">one that is more eager to defend itself<\/a><\/b>. We've already seen some interesting community scenarios on Steam Workshop created using this intel! This content remains exclusive to the optional part of the expansion, and is not officially multiplayer-compatible.<br><\/li><li><b>CBRN<\/b>: there is not much built-in platform functionality for the various pieces of Personal Protective Equipment, but we've documented some potentially useful parameters, scripts, and other methods to make use of them in your own scenarios. This includes toggling the various hoses depending on gear combinations, facewear overlays, Chemical Detector, and Decon Showers.<br><\/li><li><b>ED-1E Probing<\/b>: Maciej has also provided <b><a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Arma_3_Probing_Mechanics\" target=\"_blank\">documentation<\/a><\/b> on some of Eddie's scripted hooks that you can use in your missions. They let you control the mini UGV's various external status lights and multi-function displays, use several scripted Event Handlers for probing mechanics, and more. A <b><a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=1841970902\" target=\"_blank\">sample scenario<\/a><\/b>&nbsp;for this tech was also uploaded to Steam Workshop.<br><\/li><li><b>Spectrum Device API<\/b>: this part is not actually ready yet, but we're working on describing how scripters can plug into the device's display and register their own signals for the platform version (full functionality is still restricted to the optional data).

We don't yet have a solid release date, but we do have a first full build and are beginning to test it thoroughly. Most of the changes are also already available on Dev-Branch. In the next weeks it's therefore likely that a public Release Candidate will become available. These are the update's main highlights:<br><\/p><ul><li>Moving the <b>Contact content<\/b> mentioned above to the vanilla <b>platform data<\/b>.<br><\/li><li><b>Livonia's object addons<\/b> will be <b>decrypted to PBO<\/b>, so they can be better used by terrain modders.<br><\/li><li>We've done quite a few <b>more fixes and tweaks<\/b> to the <b>\"First Contact\" campaign<\/b>. Thanks for your <a href=\"https:\/\/forums.bohemia.net\/forums\/topic\/224435-contact-expansion-playable-content-feedback\/\" target=\"_blank\">feedback<\/a> and reports!<br><\/li><li>The change to <a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/waitUntil\" target=\"_blank\">waitUntil<\/a>, which was initially in 1.94, will be re-introduced. This means it must return true or false. If you have not already, please ensure that your usage of the command is now correct! Check <a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/waitUntil\" target=\"_blank\">its documentation<\/a> for details and scan the game for reported warnings.<br><\/li><\/ul><p>Beyond even that, we have entered a phase of Arma 3's life during which there simply is not much official development support remaining. Our focus will be on critical fixes, reacting to third-party changes affecting the game, and similar topics. Internally the game is practically on permanent so-called Data Lock. We are carefully evaluating all changes going forward, simply because it's an extremely complex and large piece of software with lots of backward-compatibility hooks that make updates risky. For that reason Arma 3 vanilla will not likely receive any major changes from this point forward. Maintenance will be handled by a very small <b>Live Ops<\/b> team with ad-hoc support from experts throughout Bohemia.<br><\/p><p>Of course, we're also still supporting the Creator DLC program together with Bohemia's Publishing division. Our current development partners have been making excellent progress. Together, we're now starting to form plans on how to best release their projects, drawing lessons from the first Creator DLC, and making improvements where possible. Speaking of which, we're pleased to announce that <a href=\"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1042220\/Arma_3_Creator_DLC_Global_Mobilization__Cold_War_Germany\/\" target=\"_blank\">Global Mobilization – Cold War Germany<\/a> has now sold more than 50,000 times. Congrats to its developers Julian and Lars over at <i>Vertexmacht<\/i>, and thanks everyone for supporting their hard work! For those interested, we'd like to point out that the Creator DLC program remains open for new applications. If you wish to partner up, please check out the <a href=\"https:\/\/arma3.com\/dlc\/creator#FAQ\" target=\"_blank\">FAQ section<\/a> on our website, and reach out to us for more information at <a href=\"mailto:businessdevelopment@bohemia.net\" target=\"_blank\">businessdevelopment@bohemia.net<\/a>. Note that your project does not need to be massive to be accepted. We're also interested to hear about proposals that are more similar in size to a Helicopters \/ Marksmen DLC.<br><\/p><p>Finally, there is a small team of designers continuing their work on the experimental \"Old Man\" project. We still don't have a specific update to share, but will do so once we can. Another aspect we're interested in pursuing more now is the release of more Arma 3 samples over time. Reinforced by its community creators, there are many more years of splendid life left for Arma 3!<br><\/p><h3>LOGISTICS<\/h3><p>We've recently <b><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Arma3official\/status\/1168860748405248000\" target=\"_blank\">refreshed the purchase options<\/a><\/b> for <a href=\"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/107410\/Arma_3\/\" target=\"_blank\">Arma 3<\/a> and all related content; now is a great time to get the full experience for a good price or to complete your collection!

Besides the Arma 3 base game and of course the Contact expansion, it contains several physical items. Use the rugged field case to transport your equipement safely, stay in contact with the two hand-held radio transceivers, be safe while wearing tin foil hats, and more. We've only produced a very limited number of these, so get yours while supplies last!<br><\/p><h3>OPERATIONS<\/h3><p>As we've done since Arma 3's early years, much of Contact's components made their way to the public <b><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Arma3official\/status\/1144225292451532803\" target=\"_blank\">Dev-Branch<\/a><\/b> and later <b><a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/rc-branch\" target=\"_blank\">RC-Branch<\/a><\/b>. Right after the project announcement, we opened up the Livonia terrain to pre-order owners, and the <a href=\"https:\/\/forums.bohemia.net\/forums\/topic\/223443-contact-expansion-livonia-feedback\/\" target=\"_blank\">feedback<\/a> has been very useful as always. Many glitches were addressed, while some other topics sadly could not anymore. We do expect to make still more smaller tweaks to object placement post-release. Over the weeks to follow, we staged the weapons, character equipment, radio protocols, and lastly vehicles. Also with these we were very happy to receive <a href=\"https:\/\/forums.bohemia.net\/forums\/topic\/223442-contact-expansion-feedback\/\" target=\"_blank\">your feedback<\/a>. Please feel free to continue sharing it also post-release. We'll be reading it and doing our best to address what is feasible. Thank you very much for the support!<br><\/p><p><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\"><div class=\"center-block\" style=\"max-width: 400px\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Arma3official\/status\/1144225292451532803\"><\/a><\/blockquote><\/div><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\">In a slight departure from previous releases, we did not stage the playable content ahead of release. There were multiple reasons for this. Mentioned before was our wish to preserve much of the mystery until release, but also there was a technical reason. The data for the campaign is stored in a Steam location for owners. Before full release, this data does not appear to download to all owners correctly, and this was not solvable in Steam. So now you will all get to enjoy \"First Contact\" at the same time. A dedicated <a href=\"https:\/\/forums.bohemia.net\/forums\/topic\/223442-contact-expansion-feedback\/\" target=\"_blank\">feedback thread<\/a> for the campaign will be opened of course.<br><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\">Speaking of the campaign, this is where the <b>PLAY CONTACT<\/b> Launcher button comes into action. Use this button (or enable the optional Contact part in the DLC tab manually) to launch Arma 3 in its Contact 'Total Conversion' mode. This mode is intended to play the campaign most of all, and perhaps tinker a bit with your own singleplayer editor creations. For all other non-alien activities, just launch Arma 3 with the regular PLAY button and without Contact manually enabled. That will still give you the Livonia terrain, most conventional assets, and compatibility with multiplayer.<br><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\">Of course another large part of this release is the <b>1.94 platform update<\/b> itself, full of the usual collected fixes, tweaks, and additions. By all means check out the full <b><a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/spotrep\" target=\"_blank\">SPOTREP<\/a><\/b> change log once it's published, but let's highlight a few important notes:<br><\/p><ul><li>The weapon attachment arrays were updated, so mods may initially not be fully compatible yet. Please allow their creators some time to iterate as well.<br><\/li><li>There was an update of the server browser protocol to version 3, which includes support for the Livonia terrain, and also Creator DLC. <a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/STEAMWORKSquery\" target=\"_blank\">Documentation<\/a> is now available.<br><\/li><li>Senior Scripter&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JosefZemanek1\" target=\"_blank\">Josef Zemánek<\/a> has continued to make improvements to Warlords multiplayer (besides also adding an instance for Livonia). Check out an <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JosefZemanek1\/status\/1141272095898423296\" target=\"_blank\">overview<\/a> of the changes!<br><\/li><\/ul><p><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\"><div class=\"center-block\" style=\"max-width: 400px\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JosefZemanek1\/status\/1141272095898423296\"><\/a><\/blockquote><\/div><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\">Because of Contact consisting of a default component (<i>Enoch<\/i> folder - available to all Arma 3 players - always loaded) and an optional component (<i>Contact<\/i> folder - available to owners - manually loaded), <b>server administrators<\/b> may want to configure which part is allowed on their servers. Enoch platform data is signed by the normal <i>A3<\/i> signature. Contact data uses a new <i>A3C<\/i> signature. The <i>Arma 3 Server<\/i> app has a main branch without Contact data, and a separate <i>Contact Build<\/i> branch with the data available. Set up a server as desired with the public keys present in <i>Keys<\/i>, and -<i>mod=Contact<\/i> or not. We'd like to point out again that Contact data is not developed for multiplayer and may not be compatible, so we expect most servers will not use nor load it.<br><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\">So let's also take a brief look at what's next. The teams will be on the look-out for critical issues following the 1.94 release. If there are none requiring a hotfix, we'll start preparing for an <b>eventual 1.96 update<\/b>. It will of course contain fixes and post-release tweaks. But we also know about several other activities that we'd like to do as much as possible:<br><\/p><ul><li>Preparing samples, such as reskin PSD templates for premium assets. This should also include samples of the various LDF camo patterns.<br><\/li><li>Creating a data package that allows terrain mod creators to use the Livonia assets in their projects.<br><\/li><li>Transferring some useful parts of Contact data to the platform, so all players and creators can use it. Examples will hopefully include: in-game music, new animations, and the hand-written font.<br><\/li><li>Writing documentation on some of the Contact gameplay mechanics and features, so it may be slightly more convenient to create your own ET singleplayer scenarios.<br><\/li><\/ul><p>We cannot provide an exact timeline for this work, since our teams simply need some rest as well, and we will be planning our next project. But as always, we will provide as much post-release support as we can.<br><\/p><h3>LOGISTICS<\/h3><p>Although it happened over a month ago, we'd like to still report on the <b>first update<\/b> to <b>Creator DLC<\/b> <b><a href=\"https:\/\/arma3.com\/dlc\/creator\" target=\"_blank\">Global Mobilization<\/a><\/b>. Please head on over to their <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Arma3official\/status\/1140976357830250496\" target=\"_blank\">SPOTREP<\/a> for the long list of fixes and improvements. The update size is rather large, which is an artifact of the EBO data encryption. Just as other DLC in the past, Steam is unable to use 'delta patching' for these files, no matter the scope of the change in a certain file. Only owners who have GM installed in Steam client will receive these updates.<br><\/p><p>On the topic of GM data, there is now a method for non-owners to play on GM servers. A <b><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/globmob_arma3\/status\/1143204441249783809\" target=\"_blank\">Compatibility Data<\/a><\/b> <b>pack<\/b> can be optionally subscribed to on Steam Workshop. Once downloaded and loaded into the game, you will be able to connect to servers using GM's non-terrain premium assets, and the usual Content Licensing system will kick in. While perhaps not the easiest solution, we hope it helps to at least split the multiplayer community a bit less.<br><\/p><p><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\"><div class=\"center-block\" style=\"max-width: 400px\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/globmob_arma3\/status\/1143204441249783809\"><\/a><\/blockquote><\/div><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\">On a final note, now is definitely the perfect time to start playing Arma 3 if you are not already (and somehow reading this any way!).

As we're 6 years into Arma 3's life, it felt like now would be the right moment. At the same time, we are aware that not everybody shares our passion for this subject. From the start of the project we have therefore done our best to build as much as possible<b> 'premise-agnostic' platform value<\/b> into the package. By that we mean additions that benefit the vanilla military sandbox without anything too unorthodox (read: alien). We believe the resulting expansion delivers lots of toys for those who only want their military sim-game, and more extras for those who do like to get a little more fictional.&nbsp;To make sure players have control over their close encounters of the Arma kind, we're distributing the expansion in 2 components. This may get a little tricky to follow, and should become more clear when the full package is available, but in essence it will work like this:<br><\/p><ul><li>Contact (Platform): this component is automatically downloaded and installed to everybody who plays Arma 3. It is loaded into the game by default, and functions like almost all previous official DLC (e.g. Helicopters, Tanks, and Apex).&nbsp;Obvious examples of such content are the new Livonia terrain, weapons, vehicles, character gear, and a vast set of props.&nbsp;Some of these are Premium Content Licensed as per usual. This data is going to be in the enoch folder of the installation (a codename of the Livonia terrain that will remain in use in the technical data).<br><\/li><li>Contact: this component is only downloaded to owners of the expansion. It is only loaded when you manually opt to do so via the <b><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/KarelMoricky\/status\/1132988757320306688\" target=\"_blank\">Launcher<\/a><\/b> for example. Examples of this data are the actual ET, the \"First Contact\" campaign, and several unorthodox systems. This data will be in the contact folder of the installation. Owners can also uninstall these files via the Arma 3 DLC section of Steam client by unchecking Contact there.<br><\/li><\/ul><p><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\"><div class=\"center-block\" style=\"max-width: 400px\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/KarelMoricky\/status\/1132988757320306688\"><\/a><\/blockquote><\/div><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\">We've seen some content creators being concerned with the optional data not being available to all. Our goal here is not to unnecessarily keep stuff from you, but we are guarding the integrity of the vanilla sandbox. Certain parts of Contact were developed for the singleplayer campaign, but are not fully compatible in multiplayer, or perhaps they override parameters of the vanilla game (as a sort of 'Total Conversion').&nbsp;<br><br>On a similar note, it's true this expansion focuses less on new platform features. The Arma 3 development team has evolved a lot over the past years, and the skill mix is simply not as diverse as it was during its primary development phase. Specifically many of our programmers have moved on to developing exciting future tech, such as the Enfusion engine. That means this expansion has a greater focus on assets, the campaign, and the overall experience of \"First Contact\". We did develop several scripted gameplay mechanics, but they are not suitable for the vanilla sandbox. An example is limited CBRN defense to use with the relevant gear. We decided to keep the gear assets available to all, even without native sandbox functionality, so that content creators can use them as they want. A few such scripts may still be possible to transfer to the platform component post-release, so that community scripters can more easily access them, but we'll evaluate that case-by-case.&nbsp;Other things may be instead possible to share with you through our Arma 3 Samples app for example. We'll be discussing this a bit more in an upcoming OPREP about the project.<br><br>Now that the project is declassified, we can give you all more of a look behind-the-scenes of Contact's development. We're trying something a little different with quick <b>mini-vlogs<\/b>, starting last week with a look at the <b><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Arma3official\/status\/1134467130798354433\" target=\"_blank\">Amsterdam office planning wall<\/a><\/b>.

Unlike Apex' Tanoa, whose data was initially only distributed to owners, Livonia data will be available to all. However, we are discussing the best option to make it possible for modders to reference the data in Terrain Builder. It's possible this will happen post-release, when the data is actually finished, but we understand the mutual benefits of doing so as soon as possible.<br><br>As has been the case with every DLC and expansion release, we'll be publishing a new <b>platform update to Arma 3 (1.94)<\/b> on July 25 as well. Besides everything needed to deploy Contact, it will contain miscellaneous fixes and improvements. A public <b><a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/rc-branch\" target=\"_blank\">Release Candidate branch<\/a><\/b> for this update will likely open in the near future. Let's take a look at a few highlights that may be good to be aware of:<br><\/p><ul><li>Quite a few script commands have had their default return value fixed in case of failure (for example when providing <b><a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/objNull\" target=\"_blank\">objNull<\/a><\/b> as argument).

Please be sure to check its expression result is always a Boolean. Fixing these commands caused a few hidden such broken script cases to trigger warnings in Arma 3 vanilla, so community scripters may want to also scan their content for these. Warnings will be shown to aid the hunt.<br><\/li><li>We've replaced the&nbsp;AITankSteeringComponent PID controller settings with re-tuned values&nbsp;that were kindly provided by the <b><a href=\"http:\/\/cup-arma3.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">CUP mod team<\/a><\/b>.

We've come a long way, and together with its developer Vertexmacht, we're incredibly excited to now roll out the first Creator DLC in the form of&nbsp;<i>Global Mobilization - Cold War Germany<\/i>. As many of you may be curious to learn more about Creator DLC, we've shared a dedicated&nbsp;<b><a href=\"https:\/\/arma3.com\/news\/arma-3-creator-dlc\" target=\"_blank\">blog post<\/a><\/b> last week, in which we describe the concept and explain where we stand now.

So far, your support for this initiative has truly been heartwarming for both us and the Creator DLC developers, and we're also grateful for the feedback on things that we need to explain better or look into again. All things considered, it looks like this is going to be a good and fun way of bringing more quality content to the Arma 3 platform, while making it possible for professional outside talent to earn a reward, and enabling ourselves to invest more into Arma's long-term future.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><\/p><p><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\"><div class=\"center-block\" style=\"max-width: 400px\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Arma3official\/status\/1118488682351165440\"><\/a><\/blockquote><\/div><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\">So, to kick things off, the&nbsp;first Creator DLC will be&nbsp;<b><i><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Arma3official\/status\/1118844827653873666\" target=\"_blank\">Global Mobilization - Cold War Germany<\/a><\/i><\/b>, which will already be deployed this&nbsp;Monday on April 29 (note: expect it to become available on Steam in the evening hours European time).

Vertexmacht<\/a><\/b>&nbsp;and learn more about these passionate game makers, how they went about the development of this Creator DLC, and to get some of their tips on how to make the most of your own projects!<br><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\"><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\"><div class=\"center-block\" style=\"max-width: 400px\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Arma3official\/status\/1120666412467523586\"><\/a><\/blockquote><\/div><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\">Before we move onto the <b>next topic<\/b> of this report (update 1.92), we'd still like to address one of the <b>main concerns<\/b> people have raised, which relates to <b>Creator DLC<\/b> being <b>optional to install<\/b>. A primary reason for this is to keep <b>Arma 3’s base game installation size<\/b> somewhat reasonable, also for those who do not own or have an interest in particular Creator DLC. However, it does also mean that players who do not own certain Creator DLC cannot join multiplayer servers or play content that makes use of that DLC’s assets (e.g. its terrain or weapons and vehicles). In response to your feedback, we're currently investigating one last potential work-around together with the Vertexmacht team. However, we also want to be careful not to give out any false hope, since this might very well prove not to be a viable option. If it does turn out to be feasible, we should already make clear that it would be unlikely for this to be available for Global Mobilization's release on Monday April 29 (or, again, if at all).<br><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\">Just to give some more insights into this, we're well aware that the optional installation and the multiplayer split between owners and non-owners it causes is not ideal and we recognize the limitations. After all, this topic has been a driving force behind <b>Arma 3's original DLC<\/b> strategy to date. Hence we completely understand that it might even be a deal-breaker for some of you running or participating in large multiplayer community groups. It's a trade-off that we had to accept so that installation size doesn't become a barrier to playing the Arma 3 base game for those with limited storage space and slower Internet speeds\/data restrictions. This will become even more relevant in the future, which looks to bring even more official and <b>Creator DLC<\/b> with individual data sizes of potentially tens of GBs.<br><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\">Besides Arma 3's default installation size, there are also other complicating factors and considerations. For example, having Creator DLC data separate from the base game enables us and the developers to do quicker updates if needed, while these would otherwise be far more complicated to do and delayed as a result. Furthermore, some future DLC might adjust core functionality or require their own scripted functionality (as a Total Conversion) that cannot be supported throughout the platform, plus we have to anticipate that cross-compatibility among future Creator DLC cannot always be guaranteed. Then there are some difficulties related to how ownership is handled on Steam and how our regular Content Licensing system is applied to in-game assets. Also, while this is perhaps a bit more of an arbitrary issue, you can imagine that the content, theme, setting, and visuals of particular Creator DLC might clash with that of regular Arma 3 and\/or other Creator DLC. Lastly, as an organisation, we need to consider not only the here and now, but also look into the long-term future and consider whether we'll be able to carry the weight of all the potential maintenance - which, with something as complex as Arma with all of its variables, can quickly take up a lot of our resources.<br><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\">All in all, we hope this explanation at least helps shed a bit more light on the matter. We very much appreciate how many of you have tried to suggest alternative solutions, even though they may not be possible in practice or may not be feasible given the complexity, infrastructure, available resources, increased overhead, and\/or other considerations. Of course, if there will be any update on this, we will make sure to share it with you as soon as possible.<br><\/p><h3>OPERATIONS<\/h3><p>Some time ago, we deployed Arma 3's&nbsp;<b><a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/post\/spotrep-00085\" target=\"_blank\">1.90 update<\/a><\/b>,&nbsp;which re-introduced important <b>multiplayer security improvements<\/b> and updates to the&nbsp;<b>Warlords&nbsp;MP mode<\/b>. We added 3 new scenarios, better support for modding, and a big amount of fixes. The&nbsp;multiplayer security improvements,&nbsp;which we originally tried to implement in&nbsp;Arma 3's <b><a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/post\/spotrep-00082\" target=\"_blank\">1.86 update<\/a><\/b>, have certainly been no easy beast to tame. Various communities still experienced more issues with these improvements, and after some extended testing with several groups we hope to have identified and addressed the bigger issues in follow-up <b>hotfixes<\/b>. These also contained more diagnostic information for admins to more accurately identify potential configuration or data troubles. Please check <b><a href=\"https:\/\/forums.bohemia.net\/forums\/topic\/222192-190-update-troubleshooting\/\" target=\"_blank\">this forums thread<\/a><\/b> for a list of further tips.&nbsp;For details you can find the full change logs of&nbsp;the&nbsp;<b><a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/post\/spotrep-00086\" target=\"_blank\">first<\/a><\/b> and <b><a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/post\/spotrep-00087\" target=\"_blank\">second<\/a><\/b> hotfix in the form of the usual <b><a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/spotrep\" target=\"_blank\">SPOTREPs<\/a><\/b>.<br><\/p><p><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\"><div class=\"center-block\" style=\"max-width: 400px\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Arma3official\/status\/1108339595392045057\"><\/a><\/blockquote><\/div><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\">We are now getting very close to releasing Arma 3's&nbsp;<b>1.92 update<\/b>, so let's take a look at what's included. First up, we've implemented some changes to the&nbsp;<b>Arma 3 Launcher<\/b>&nbsp;in preparation of the release of our first Creator DLC. Specifically, we've added a&nbsp;<b>DLC tab<\/b> that makes it possible to <b>load or unload 'optional DLC'<\/b>. This means you can keep optional DLC data installed on your PC, but still run the game without having them enabled, which especially in the case of a Total Conversion is something that you might want to do. The Launcher does allow users to enable multiple optional DLC, but compatibility is not guaranteed. To complete the new DLC section, we've also listed the traditional 'default DLC' here as an overview. Default DLC is always installed, so you cannot actually disable it.<br><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\">In a prior update we already introduced technology to support so-called&nbsp;<b><a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Arma_3_Magazine_Proxies\" target=\"_blank\">magazine proxies<\/a><\/b>&nbsp;(dynamic weapon magazines).&nbsp;This allows you to load different types of magazines into compatible weapons visually, whereas in the past they were 'baked' into the weapon model. Prior to the 1.92 update this feature was not yet applied to our vanilla weapons, although some mod teams have made good use of it already. In the upcoming 1.92 update however, most vanilla weapons will support this. A simple example is being able to load different color MX magazines into each MX class weapon. There is a small draw-back to this change, but we believe it's overcome by the gameplay flexibility provided. Some character \/ vehicle \/ container loadouts have had to be changed with the new magazine classes (e.g. NATO Pacific and Syndikat). If a scenario or scripted system was manipulating those loadouts by script and using class names, that may not work as intended anymore.<br><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\">Especially recently, we've received quite a few reports regarding the misbehavior of certain players on our official servers, and specifically our Warlords servers. Understandably, this makes it hard for people to enjoy their multiplayer experience. Unfortunately, the solution to this is not as simple as increasing the number of server administrators.

While some of these may feature in 1.92, a lot of these changes are still experimental. It is possible further improvements will be tested via the special Profiling Branch for server admins.

Although a large part of the original Arma 3 development team is now working on Bohemia's new Enfusion engine, which means we'll not be introducing any major new gameplay features, we do have quite some <b>new content<\/b> lined up. For example, our developers in Bohemia's Amsterdam office are collaborating with our people in the Czech Republic and Thailand on a <b>fairly unusual yet sizeable Arma 3 DLC<\/b>. This is progressing very nicely, and it'll bring various <b>bigger and smaller assets<\/b> to the wider Arma 3 sandbox, alongside several top secret components. Apart from that, we're also happy to report some <b>good progress<\/b> on the first <b><a href=\"https:\/\/forums.bohemia.net\/forums\/topic\/211488-arma-3-third-party-dlc-pitch-invitation\/\" target=\"_blank\">third-party DLC<\/a><\/b>. We're not ready yet to share any specifics on all of this just yet, but please stand by for the official announcements later in the year.<br><\/p><p>Moving forward, our <b><a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/sitrep\" target=\"_blank\">SITREPs<\/a><\/b> (Situation Reports) will be posted <b>monthly<\/b> (instead of bi-weekly). In addition we'll be introducing a new monthly news item called the <b>Community Radar<\/b> (#COMRAD). As a result, our SITREPs should again focus primarily on the status of development, whereas the Community Radar will enable us to spotlight more amazing things that are happening in the Arma 3 community.<br><\/p><p>We're currently establishing the exact format of the Community Radar. It will most likely be structured into <b>five main categories<\/b>: Art, Development, Videos, Livestreams, and Events - and the first edition should be posted in two weeks. So, if there's something you'd like to see featured, we advise you to share your content on one of the following forum links; <b><a href=\"https:\/\/forums.bohemia.net\/forums\/topic\/138904-arma-3-photography-pictures-only-no-comments-and-list-your-addons-used\/\" target=\"_blank\">Art<\/a><\/b>, <b><a href=\"https:\/\/forums.bohemia.net\/forums\/forum\/156-arma-3-addons-mods-complete\/\" target=\"_blank\">Development<\/a><\/b>, <a href=\"https:\/\/forums.bohemia.net\/forums\/topic\/206093-arma3-videos\/\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Videos<\/b><\/a>, or on <b><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Arma3official\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter<\/a><\/b> by tagging <b>@Arma3official<\/b> or <b>#Arma3<\/b>.

Given the complexity of the <b>Arma 3<\/b> platform and all its (modded) variables, there's unfortunately no quick fix to this - or at least not something that could be released straight away without thorough testing. As such we decided to first release a <b>hotfix<\/b> that reverted the security improvements (and which also required changing the game version number from <b>1.86<\/b> to <b>1.88<\/b>). However, this temporary revert didn't come without a (temporary) casualty. Since the <b>hotfix<\/b>, there's an issue with Arma 3's in-game server browser where it incorrectly displays a <b>red flag<\/b> for various servers, even though users wanting to join fulfill all the prerequisites. You will often be able to ignore the <b>red flag<\/b> and still join the server. However, our primary recommendation for now is to make use of the external <b>server browser<\/b> that's incorporated into the <b>Arma 3 Launcher<\/b>. We're currently working on solving this issue, and might release another hotfix. With regards to the security improvements that were now reverted, we're still eager to roll these out at some point in the future as they should help to prevent cheating in <b>Arma 3 multiplayer<\/b>. Our current plan is to make a version of Arma 3 with these <b>security improvements<\/b> enabled available for <b>RC-Branch <\/b>as soon as possible, so that after some vigorous testing in all kinds of (modded) multiplayer environments, we can hopefully re-introduce these improvements somewhere in the new year. We'll make sure to ask everyone, especially server hosts, mod-makers, and community groups, to help us test the <b>RC-branch<\/b> once it's live. <br><\/p><p><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\"><div class=\"center-block\" style=\"max-width: 400px\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Arma3official\/status\/1069604044497477632\"><\/a><\/blockquote><\/div><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\">Since the update went live, we've also been closely monitoring your <b><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JosefZemanek1\/status\/1071460360576794624\" target=\"_blank\">feedback<\/a><\/b> on the <b>Warlords<\/b> multiplayer mode itself, and we're already working on a few fixes and improvements.

The situation is that we'd very much like to make Arma 3 available on those platforms, and we've been collaborating with our business partner <b><i>Virtual Programming<\/i><\/b> to make this a possibility (with Arma 3 update 1.82 being the most recent port update). However, each of these <b>Experimental Port<\/b> updates are quite demanding in terms of preparation and testing. Plus, the work can only begin after the official <b>Windows<\/b> version of Arma 3 has been successfully deployed to the public. On top of that, the port updates are simply quite expensive. So as our time and other resources are limited, we do need to consider the business side of things. With that in mind, we're currently not yet planning a new port update. However, it is something we might consider again in the future, when fewer updates for Arma 3 are to be expected. Nonetheless, even though we've always been careful to communicate the ports as experimental, we realize that some of you might be disappointed, and we very much appreciate your understanding. For now, in case you would like to play with friends who are running the main Windows version of Arma 3, we will make sure that a <b>legacy branch<\/b> of Arma 3 version 1.82 remains available for them.

We'll also briefly cover our first ever Community Playsession livestream, for which we joined the 4th Infantry Brigade in one of their mil-sim operations. And, as always, we'll report on some of the latest activity in the Arma 3 community.<br><\/p><h3>INTELLIGENCE<\/h3><p>Last Wednesday we shared an <b><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Arma3official\/status\/1060164096929251329\" target=\"_blank\">update on our 2018 roadmap<\/a><\/b>. We recommend reading the <b><a href=\"https:\/\/arma3.com\/news\/arma-3-roadmap-2018-november-update\" target=\"_blank\">devblog<\/a><\/b> in full if you’re interested in what we still have in store for this year, and to learn more about our plans for Arma 3 in 2019. One of the key takeaways is that, after 5 years of post-release support and Arma 3 becoming a more stable platform, the game will be moving into a <b>more experimental stage<\/b>. This involves us undertaking somewhat unconventional smaller and bigger projects, as well as working with outside developers to publish original third-party DLC for Arma 3.<\/p><p><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\"><div class=\"center-block\" style=\"max-width: 400px\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Arma3official\/status\/1060164096929251329\"><\/a><\/blockquote><\/div><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\">The <b>“Old Man”<\/b> <b>(codename)<\/b> project, which we first mentioned in our <b><a href=\"https:\/\/arma3.com\/news\/arma-3-roadmap-2018\" target=\"_blank\">July roadmap update<\/a><\/b>, and which was initially targeting a release in 2018, is one of those smaller experimental projects. This <b>free open-world scenario set on Tanoa<\/b> is developed by a team of three designers and represents an opportunity for us to learn more about what works in terms of open-world gameplay and what doesn’t. Prototyping the scenario has already revealed lots of design challenges, which will take more time to overcome. For that reason, a release of the free scenario is <b>not in the cards for this year<\/b>.<br><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\">We are excited to announce the soon-to-be-released <b>Warlords Update (version 1.86)<\/b>. The main highlight of this update is the introduction of a new <b>large-scale team-vs-team multiplayer mode<\/b> called Warlords. This new mode is the brainchild of Senior Designer &amp; Scripter, <i><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JosefZemanek1\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Josef Zemánek<\/b><\/a><\/i> (aka Jezuro), and actually already existed on the Steam Workshop since 2015 as his personal project. Over the past few months, we’ve been actively working on the official version, which will offer a more <b>evolved and much more refined experience<\/b> over the original Warlords. Learn more about the rules of the mode and its development in our latest <b><a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/post\/oprep-warlords\" target=\"_blank\">OPREP<\/a><\/b> written by Josef himself.<br><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\">As a fun easter egg for creative screenshooters, the upcoming update will also add five special characters in the form of prominent Arma developers. These new characters are largely the result of an R&amp;D project to test Bohemia’s new photogrammetry system (and workflow). This is a special rig that will enable us to more accurately and efficiently create virtual heads and faces. In the case of Arma 3, it did mean we had to adjust the head shapes of these new special characters. As a result, there are some limitations so to avoid potential graphical glitches because of mis-matching in-game clothing items, and these special characters miss facial animations (e.g. lip-syncing and eye-blinking) partly due to their eyes and mouth being in offset places. As such, it will not be possible to customize the characters in the Virtual Arsenal, and they will be implemented in a way that is more similar to ‘story’ characters such as the (in)famous Captain Scott Miller.<br><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\">Last but not least, Update 1.86 will implement our official mod, the <b><a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=669962280\" target=\"_blank\">ADR-97 weapon pack<\/a><\/b>, to the base game. This means that you will be able to add these weapons to your loadouts without having to subscribe to the mod on the Steam Workshop. All in all, the Warlords Update is currently available for testing on RC-Branch and is expected to be released to Main-Branch in less than a few weeks.<br><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\"><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\"><div class=\"center-block\" style=\"max-width: 400px\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Arma3official\/status\/1060890127717818368\"><\/a><\/blockquote><\/div><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\">In other news, last week we hosted our first ever <b><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Homesikh\/status\/1062368774668587010\" target=\"_blank\">Community Playsession<\/a><\/b>, which was streamed live to the <b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.twitch.tv\/videos\/332894683\" target=\"_blank\">Twitch channel<\/a><\/b> of <b><i><a href=\"https:\/\/www.twitter.com\/Homesikh\" target=\"_blank\">yours truly<\/a><\/i><\/b>, and served as a pilot for future official Arma 3 livestreams.

Besides that, there are two other notable updates related to our recent development progress worth mentioning:<br><\/p><p>In a previous <b><a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/post\/sitrep-00226\" target=\"_blank\">SITREP<\/a><\/b> we talked about <b><a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Magazine_Proxies\" target=\"_blank\">magazine proxies<\/a><\/b>. This is a feature that allows you to use several visual types of magazines in the same weapon. Unfortunately, the data implementation of the functionality will not be quite ready yet for the Warlords Update, as it still requires some more updates to Arma 3's vanilla weapons. The update does already prepare the configuration data for community mods to utilize this feature and some of the vanilla magazines. We aim to share more technical details on this on our <b>forums<\/b>.<br><\/p><p>For some time we've been bothered by how short the <b>audible distances<\/b> of our ground vehicles were. With a twist to a famous quote, one could say: \"if you hear a tank, it's already too late\". With <i><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BohemiaTank\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Edita<\/b><\/a><\/i> as the on-site consultant and after several hearing impairment accidents, we're happy to report that this has been improved. You should now be able to hear a tank coming from a vast distance, or know if there is a tank inside a village close to you. This feature has also been adjusted in accordance with what a player would expect from various types and sizes of vehicles. That means that a tank is louder than an APC, and an APC is louder than a truck, and so on.<br><\/p><h3>LOGISTICS<\/h3><p>We recently began public testing of the upcoming Warlords Update (1.86) via our <b><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Arma3official\/status\/1060574567083794432\" target=\"_blank\">public Release Candidate<\/a><\/b> <b>(RC-Branch)<\/b>.

Its many iterations have been among the most played multiplayer modes in the Arma series. When I joined Bohemia to work on Arma 2, the game was still very early in development, so the go-to multiplayer experience in the Mníšek office was the 'Sahrani Warfare' scenario\/mode for Arma 1. I've always loved Warfare for the sandbox gameplay it offered, and our evening\/night play sessions (and the following \"debriefs\") are among the best gaming memories I have.<\/p> <p>I wasn't directly involved in the development of Warfare for Arma 2 as I was working on the campaign, and we decided not to continue with Warfare for Arma 3. Still, I always knew that I'd want to come up with something similar to Warfare for our latest installment in the franchise. So, when time allowed, I began working on my take on CTI.<\/p> <h2> FROM WORKSHOP TO VANILLA <\/h2> <p>After a couple of weeks, the first version of this new mode, which would eventually be named \"Warlords\", was ready for internal playtesting. We did a couple of sessions in the office and the feedback came flowing in. However, at that time, the team unfortunately didn't have the time or resources required to finish, polish, and release a whole new game mode on top of the already planned End Game mode. So the work on Warlords was discontinued for some time. Later, in 2015, when it seemed that Warlords would never get released as an official mode, I realized that it would be nice if our players at least had the chance to play the mode, even if it was not part of the vanilla game. As a result, Warlords was released on the Steam Workshop In the summer of that year. The reception was very positive and I started working on somewhat regular updates in my spare time.<\/p> <p class=\"text-center\"> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/warlords_shot_01.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/warlords_shot_01.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\" height=\"\" width=\"\"><\/a> <\/p> <p>Seeing that it was doing relatively well on the Workshop, and because we like how it makes great use of our large-scale terrains, we eventually decided already some time ago that we would release Warlords officially after all. However, it wasn't really clear when this would happen or in what way. And as such I wasn't yet able to share this information with the players who subscribed to the Steam Workshop version of Warlords. They had to believe my word that I was not done with Warlords and that I would be able to share some exciting news with them when the time was right. In the meantime, I continued working on Warlords whenever the schedule would allow it (meaning when I didn't need to work on other projects), improving existing features, adding some minor new ones, as well as fixing some nasty issues.<\/p> <p class=\"text-center\"> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/warlords_shot_02.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/warlords_shot_02.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\" height=\"\" width=\"\"><\/a> <\/p> <p>I'd like to thank all of you for providing feedback and sticking around even if I was quite vague about new info for these last two years. I hope that the updated official version of Warlords you'll receive with Update 1.86 will be worth the wait. I think the first thing you will probably notice is the Request menu, which definitely needed the most love, but there are also countless other improvements that make the gameplay much more enjoyable. By the way, we've now also prepared Warlords scenarios for all official Arma 3 terrains. Some of the scenarios contain just a few sectors for those looking for a quick skirmish, but naturally there are also full-blown CTI operations stretching across the entire terrain!<\/p> <h2> IT'S WHAT YOU LEAVE OUT... <\/h2> <p>Those of you who have already tried out the Workshop version of Warlords will know that some of the features that became sort of standard for CTI game modes are missing. The most obvious definitely being base building. This is something I decided from the start not to implement. Some people will miss it of course, and I recognize it provides an additional strategic layer, but for the vision I had for Warlords it simply wouldn't feel right. I wanted the player to connect to the game and be able to immediately join the fight, without needing to navigate to a certain building that would provide some service he required.<\/p> <p>Another feature has to do with player progression, which was something I wasn't particularly fond of, simply because I feel it would artificially cut some players off certain features simply because they haven't been playing (or grinding) long enough.<\/p> <p>The reasoning behind these decisions is simple: you join the game, you know what to do, where to go, and who to attack in order to push towards the enemy base. You know where to go and defend to prevent the enemy from getting to your base. And how well you perform depends only on your skill and not your rank.<\/p> <h2> THE RULES, THE INS AND OUTS <\/h2> <p>Now would be a good time to finally explain the rules. Here's a brief summary:<\/p> <ul> <li>BLUFOR and OPFOR factions fight for the control of individual sectors, which are initially controlled by a third independent faction. <\/li> <li>Through these sectors, players gradually advance to their enemy's base.<\/li> <li>The game ends when one of the competing faction loses control over their base.<\/li> <li>Each sector periodically generates a certain amount of Command Points for the faction that controls that sector. <ul> <li>These points can be used to request additional troops, vehicles, aircraft, gear, as well as various strategic advantages such as Fast Travel. <\/li> <li>Players also get awarded extra Command Points for eliminating enemies and seizing a sector for the first time.<\/li> <\/ul> <\/li> <\/ul><p> <div class=\"img-wrapper\"> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/warlords_shot_05.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-3\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/warlords_shot_05.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\" height=\"\" width=\"\"><\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/warlords_shot_04.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-3\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/warlords_shot_04.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\" height=\"\" width=\"\"><\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/warlords_shot_03.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-3\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/warlords_shot_03.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\" height=\"\" width=\"\"><\/a> <\/div> <\/p><p>Those are the general rules of Warlords. There are some more details I'd like to mention here as well:<\/p> <ul> <li>You can play with the players in one faction against the other faction which will be controlled by the AI. You can even play solo with friendly AI troops. Just leave some slots in the lobby open and the system will automatically fill them with AI. <\/li> <li>By default, playable soldiers of one faction (even if they're temporarily controlled by AI) always respawn inside their faction's base. However, when this base has been targeted by the enemy faction, players will respawn some distance away to prevent continuous popping up of troops in an enemy-controlled area. <\/li> <li>The maximum number of AI subordinates you can have is 9. However, if your teammates die too rapidly, command will refuse to send more troops to their death under your leadership, and it will take some time before you can request more men again. <\/li> <li>In the default version of Warlords, you will not find any artillery units. Simply put, they have proven to be extremely deadly and until we'd find a reasonable solution there won't be any artillery shells raining from the sky. <\/li> <li>The spawning of enemies is randomized, which means they spawn in different locations with different vehicles each time.<\/li> <li>You can tweak a lot of settings in the Parameters menu. For example, you can disable Fast Travel or the stamina system, accelerate day-night cycles, set up the sectors so that they are controlled by playable factions from the start, and more. <\/li> <\/ul> <h2> MOVING FORWARD <\/h2> <p>One more thing I'd want to point out is that I'm particularly happy with how easy it is to customize your Warlords experience. Setting up your own Warlords scenario is just a matter of minutes. Implementing community-made assets instead of vanilla ones is very straightforward too. If you follow these guidelines, you can have your mission up and running in no time on any map you want.<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/MP_Warlords\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Community wiki - How to set up your Warlords scenario<\/a><\/p> <p>Of course, we'll also be providing official servers to play Warlords on, and we hope to see community servers running modded versions of the mode as well. After all the future of Warlords in mostly in your hands, the players. We'll be reviewing any feedback you provide (please share it with us on the <a href=\"https:\/\/forums.bohemia.net\/forums\/topic\/182339-warlords\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">forums<\/a>), and naturally there will be some time dedicated to future balance tweaks and improvements. If the playerbase if big enough, there could be even some larger-scale updates, but that remains to be seen.

One of these involves a different approach to how weapon deployment is handled when you're prone. The current implementation is very restricted and comes with several visual issues such as levitating legs. The new approach to weapon deployment on the ground makes things a lot less restrictive. However, some might feel that it makes things less authentic. As such it's a bit of a trade-off, and we'd appreciate your feedback on the subject. The new method is available for testing on <b><a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/dev-branch\" target=\"_blank\">Dev-Branch<\/a><\/b> right now.<br><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\">We've also added a new wiki page for something we refer to as <b><a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Magazine_Proxies\" target=\"_blank\">Magazine Proxies<\/a><\/b>. This is a feature that allows you to use several types of magazines in the same weapon, as long as they pack the same calibre ammunition. For example, you could have an MX assault rifle with a 30-round 6.5mm magazine, and be able to swap that magazine with a 100-round 6.5mm magazine. This functionality was already made available to modders as part of Arma 3 version 1.78, but was not used for our official weapons yet. However, although we're not sure when the work will be finished, our goal is to update all our weapons to support this functionality in one of the upcoming platform updates.<br><\/p><h3>LOGISTICS<br><\/h3><p class=\"twitter-embed\">Have you ever had issues finding your way around the different Arma terrains?

For those who are wondering why these ports were updated to version 1.82 instead of the new 1.84 version, this is because these ports are prepared by our partners at <i><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/virtualprog\" target=\"_blank\">Virtual Programming<\/a><\/i> and it takes a fair amount of time to create them, accounting also for platform-specific issues. Unfortunately, this work can also only start after the regular Windows version is completely ready, tested, deployed, and if needed, hotfixed. As such, it's realistically not feasible to release the Windows version and Linux\/Mac ports of Update 1.84 all at once. Also, please be aware that the Ports are still in an <b>experimental phase<\/b>, which mean some disclaimers apply (learn more on the the <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/ports\" target=\"_blank\">Arma 3 Dev Hub<\/a>). As for future port updates, even though we'd like to make Arma 3 available to as many people as possible, we're currently evaluating the expected popularity of these ports versus how much they cost to prepare.

It allows us to weed out any last-minute issues that may have been missed in the <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/dev-branch\" target=\"_blank\">Dev-Branch<\/a> or internal development builds. It's also an opportunity for us to stress test the new game version in a multiplayer environment, which is where most issues typically occur. Plus, if needed, mod-makers can use this build to prepare their creations for the new game version. In the particular case of the <b>Encore Update<\/b> (version 1.84), we'll be delivering a bunch of <b>free new assets<\/b> to all Arma 3 players, such as the destroyer-class ship, SAM systems, and radar sites. Of course it's very important that these all work as intended. Hence, if you want to help out, you're more than welcome to check out the RC build and report any potential issues to our <a href=\"https:\/\/feedback.bistudio.com\/project\/view\/1\/\" target=\"_blank\">Feedback Tracker<\/a>. Thank you in advance! If all goes well, we hope to officially release the Encore Update next week or the week thereafter.

One of its main highlights is the addition of the Mi-24 (Kosta) 3370, which just like the other choppers, sports the squadron's distinct tiger crest and tiger stripes. For those who don't know, this special <b>Czech helicopter squadron<\/b> is part of the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/NATO_Tiger_Association\" target=\"_blank\">NATO Tiger Association<\/a>, which was first established in 1961.

To give you a better understanding of the status of Arma 3 Units, Brand &amp; PR manager <i><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/korneelvantland\" target=\"_blank\">Korneel van 't Land<\/a><\/i> shared a <a href=\"https:\/\/forums.bohemia.net\/forums\/topic\/186322-arma-3-units-feedback-thread\/?do=findComment&amp;comment=3295659\" target=\"_blank\">brief update<\/a> on the Bohemia Forums: <i>\"All further development of Arma 3 Units has been put on hold as our web developers now have other priorities. When we first started to work on Arma 3 Units, we knew beforehand that it was going to a challenge to fit into our schedules, which is why we planned to build it in three steps: step 1 (priority: must) - be able to create a unit profile page, step 2 (priority: should) - be able to have members via Bohemia Accounts and some modest in-game integration, step 3 (priority: could) - more elaborate features like being able to plan events. Although we managed to implement steps 1 and 2, it unfortunately seems unlikely that step 3 will happen. Nevertheless, what started as a somewhat experimental side project really became popular beyond our expectations, and so I think we'd all wish to see such a platform be part of our future games. All in all, I'd say that Arma 3 Units is still a very useful way to more easily form or find a group with all of the base functionality being present. It might never leave 'beta', but we want to make sure it remains functional in the foreseeable future.\"<\/i><br><\/p><h3>LOGISTICS<\/h3><p class=\"twitter-embed\">Over the last few weeks, Arma 3 has received <b>two security fixes<\/b>.

The last year has been very busy for both ourselves and Bohemia.

motivation for choosing these assets was primarily driven by community feedback. The creative execution and gameplay balance were top priorities for the design team. <a href=\"https:\/\/arma3.com\/dlc\/jets\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jets DLC<\/a> was never just about fast jets. We wanted to enhance every aspect of the above-ground battle-space. The team has maintained this game-balancing approach, adding an exciting combination of new features, weapons, static objects, and autonomous assets, to further enhance the Arma 3 experience.<\/p> <h3> <i>The Ship<\/i> <\/h3> <p>Our expert ship-building artist <strong>Don Ray Reed IV<\/strong> took on the challenge of creating a unique new ship model with a fully detailed interior, the “USS Liberty” destroyer. Using the expertise acquired from building the largest ship in Arma 3 - the “USS Freedom” aircraft carrier - he has again delivered an awesome asset that pushes Arma 3 boundaries even further. His design of the internal layout allows mission designers and players to use this asset as a versatile starting platform for a wide range of missions. It features both small boat and helicopter deployment and powerful new naval fire-support capabilities. The ship itself is like a small map on the water. Featuring additional props and naval weapons systems, this platform can be easily customized by community mission designers and players.<\/p> <p> <div class=\"img-wrapper\"> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/NATO_Destroyer_4.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-2\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/NATO_Destroyer_4.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\" height=\"\" width=\"\"><\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/NATO_Destroyer_3.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-2\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/NATO_Destroyer_3.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\" height=\"\" width=\"\"><\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/NATO_Destroyer_1.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-2\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/NATO_Destroyer_1.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\" height=\"\" width=\"\"><\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/NATO_Destroyer_5.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-2\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/NATO_Destroyer_5.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\" height=\"\" width=\"\"><\/a> <\/div> <\/p> <h3> <i>Radar &amp; SAM Systems<\/i> <\/h3> <p>While part of our team was ship-building, <strong>Luiz Cordova<\/strong> and <strong>Rob Graham<\/strong> were developing devastating new assets to test pilot skills and allow mission designers enhanced control of airspace and improved balance.

However, we aim for this to happen sooner than later.<br><\/p><h3>INTELLIGENCE<br><\/h3><p>Bohemia Interactive has once again joined forces with <b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.humblebundle.com\/games\/arma-2018-bundle\" target=\"_blank\">Humble Bundle<\/a><\/b> to provide an amazing deal on an armada of <i>Arma<\/i> games and expansions between 29th May and 12th June.

This fixed some issues that were introduced with the <a href=\"https:\/\/arma3.com\/dlc\/tanks\" target=\"_blank\">Tanks DLC<\/a> release. Since then, our modest development team has continued working on <b>tweaks and fixes<\/b>. The goal of this effort is to make the platform more <b>stable and enjoyable<\/b> in the long term for both players and community creators.<br><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\">Although it's taking us a bit longer to prepare our roadmap (mainly due to organizational restructuring), our day-to-day work on <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/dev-branch\" target=\"_blank\">Dev-Branch<\/a> marched on without (much) interruption! To give a few examples, players may have noticed further tweaks to missiles and munitions: several (active radar homing) missiles now <b>better react to counter-measures<\/b>, while the splash damage of <b>HEAT ammunition<\/b> was slightly increased. There have also been some quite nice <b>fixes to AI<\/b>. AI drivers will now try to stick to the right side of roads more than before and should also <b>navigate a bit better<\/b> across bridges. Moreover, AI soldiers are no longer able to see and shoot through fallen trees and walls. We hope this improvement (which, admittedly, took us few more years to implement than is desired) helps with the immersion when operating alongside or against our AI combatants!<br><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\">Last but not least, our Designers have been fixing and <b>optimizing all of the playable<\/b> content in Arma 3. The goal is to make the experience more consistent and enjoyable. As you might imagine, Arma 3 has been out for a while now, and some of its scenarios were released during <a href=\"https:\/\/arma3.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Arma 3<\/a>'s Early Access era. Since then we've added new assets and engine features to the game, but not all of our playable content incorporated those additions properly. We're now trying to change that, even though it proves to be an enormous amount of work! To put this into some more perspective, our brave Designers have to go through 64 campaign scenarios, 26 Showcases, 22 multiplayer scenarios, 17 Time Trials, 13 Firing Drills, 15 VR Training courses, and 27 Zeus scenarios. On top of that, all of their changes need to be carefully tested, and only after everything is confirmed and approved, we can include them in Arma 3's next Main Branch update. Kudos to the team for this effort!<br><\/p><h3>LOGISTICS<br><\/h3><p class=\"twitter-embed\">As has become a yearly tradition, <b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.moddb.com\/news\/mod-appreciation-week-2018\" target=\"_blank\">Mod Appreciation Week<\/a> <\/b>has just started over at <i><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ModDB\/status\/1000889639736168448\" target=\"_blank\">ModDB<\/a><\/i>.

This should answer some remaining questions before we can share our future plans for the game. Keep in mind that many of our developers will slowly begin to move onto other projects at Bohemia.

Great job on this rapid and splendid introduction!<br><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\"><div class=\"video-wrapper\" id=\"lMgm0EaC4Lk\"><div class=\"absolute-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=lMgm0EaC4Lk\" data-video=\"lMgm0EaC4Lk\" data-container=\".video-wrapper#lMgm0EaC4Lk\" data-removeitem=\".video-wrapper#lMgm0EaC4Lk .btn\" class=\"btn btn-play\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-play\"><\/span><\/a><\/div><img src=\"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/lMgm0EaC4Lk\/maxresdefault.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"><\/div><br><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\">The stars of the <a href=\"https:\/\/arma3.com\/dlc\/tanks\" target=\"_blank\">Tanks DLC<\/a> show are of course the <b>three new armored vehicles<\/b>. Perhaps the most conventional one is the <b>T-140 Angara<\/b>. This is a modern Main Battle Tank for the CSAT faction and it's built for <b>destroying everything<\/b> in its path. It also comes in a Commander variant, and players can select different paint jobs \/ liveries to change its appearance. Next up, we've added a rather unusual tank: the <b>Nyx Armored Weapons Carrier<\/b>. This AAF asset might not seem like a total bad-ass steel machine at first glance, but it's a typical case of looks being deceiving. The Nyx's AT variant is equipped with <b>FireFIST missiles<\/b> that are able to neutralize any armored target. It also comes in <b>Anti-Aircraft, Autocannon<\/b>, and <b>Recon variants<\/b>. Due to its smaller size and weight, the Nyx is able to outmaneuver larger enemies, and it can even be sling-loaded by copter. Last but not least, the <b>Rhino Mobile Gun System<\/b> will enrich the NATO faction. While this vehicle is technically not a tank, its 120mm cannon makes it more than capable of hunting them. This is also why we refer to it as a <b>'Tank Destroyer'<\/b>. The Rhino can be connected to the <a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Arma_3_Sensors#Data_Link\" target=\"_blank\">Data Link<\/a>, and its cannon-launched guided MARUK missile can even hit targets that are hidden behind hills or other obstacles. This wheeled armored vehicle requires a clever vehicle crew, which makes it really <b>rewarding<\/b> to play with. Furthermore on the asset front, we've wanted to balance out some of this new armored might by providing several options to counter it. Pick up the new 9M135 Vorona and MAAWS Mk4 launchers, or catch a ride in the new AT car variants and <b>hunt them down<\/b>.<br><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\"><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\"><div class=\"center-block\" style=\"max-width: 400px\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Arma3official\/status\/973228057803837443\"><\/a><\/blockquote><\/div><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\">Besides the new vehicles, Tanks DLC also features premium playable content in the form of a short <b>mini-campaign<\/b> called \"Altis Requiem\". Here, you'll be operating the new Angara and Nyx, and you get to experience the other side of the <b>NATO offensive<\/b> on Altis. Without spoiling too much, it's a <b>refreshing perspective<\/b> on the events from Arma 3's original \"The East Wind\" campaign. To also introduce the Rhino properly, Designer <i><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/SgS_Sarge\" target=\"_blank\">Václav Kerber<\/a><\/i> has been working on <b>Showcase Tank Destroyers<\/b>. This singleplayer scenario gives players the opportunity to learn the ropes of playing as a Tank Destroyer. We do also have 3 fun Time Trials in the works, but those need a little bit more time in the garage before they arrive to Dev-Branch. As a free additional bonus for everyone who owns Arma 3, our Designers have also created a brand new competitive <b>multiplayer mode<\/b>. It's called \"Vanguard\", and combines elements of Team Death Match and Capture The Flag in Team-vs-Team combined arms scenarios. If you want to try it right now on <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/dev-branch\" target=\"_blank\">Dev-Branch<\/a>, we already have official servers set up both in Europe and overseas!<br><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\">We're also adding tons of <b>free decorative objects<\/b>, including a <b>functional repair depot<\/b>.

In this paragraph, we'll be <b>introducing some of these features<\/b> one by one.<br><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\">In December 2017, our Art Department has deployed three <b>fully modelled interiors<\/b> of our vanilla wheeled APCs to Dev-Branch. This effort was then further introduced by Art Lead <i>Luboš Groch<\/i> in his <b><a href=\"https:\/\/arma3.com\/news\/report-in-lubos-groch-art\" target=\"_blank\">Report In article<\/a><\/b>. We promised to add interiors for the rest of our armored vehicles as well. And <b><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jiri_lank\/status\/966334030726815744\" target=\"_blank\">here they are<\/a>!<\/b> Each armored vehicle in Arma 3 now has a fully 3D <b>modeled interior<\/b>, along with a full set of fresh <b>crew animations, Multi-Functional Displays<\/b> and <b>Picture-in-Picture feeds<\/b>. You may notice that the Main Battle Tanks got some <b>extra love<\/b>, resulting in even more richly detailed interiors. You can expect a similar level of quality, if not better, for the Tanks DLC's new premium vehicles (yet to be introduced). This addition represents a huge amount of multi-disciplinary work and forms a <b>key piece<\/b> of the Tanks package. We're incredibly excited to be supporting both new and already released armored assets with such an <b>immersive upgrade!<\/b><br><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\"><div class=\"center-block\" style=\"max-width: 400px\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jiri_lank\/status\/966334030726815744\"><\/a><\/blockquote><\/div><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\">​It has become a tradition that almost all of our DLCs come with a free platform update that delivers free new <b>engine features<\/b> and free bonus content to everyone who owns Arma 3. Tanks DLC will be <b>no exception<\/b>, with one of the main platform features being available right now on <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/dev-branch\" target=\"_blank\">Dev-Branch<\/a>. The <b><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/_Asheara\/status\/966334029875367936\" target=\"_blank\">Extended Damage Model<\/a> for armored vehicles<\/b> aims to re-define the way they fight against each other, as well as the way infantry fights against these metal monsters.<\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\">Our splendid Technical Designer <i><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/_Asheara\" target=\"_blank\">Katarína Smiešková<\/a><\/i>, who worked on this feature in a close collaboration with our programmers, explains what this overhaul brings: <i>\"Many of you know that in our damage model's current state the calculation of the damage dealt can be quite unpredictable at times. Therefore, we're really happy to announce the new <b>component system<\/b>, which will significantly reduce this problem and <b>increase the transparency<\/b> of the damage dealt. Calculating a round's penetration will be much more precise. Furthermore, there are several smaller features to improve Arma 3's quality-of-life for our dear <b>community creators<\/b>. The intention is to make their job of implementing the damage model easier. We do this by decreasing the amount of variables they had to take into consideration thus far and which often fell under the category of 'black magic'. However, the number one game-changer when it comes to this feature is the simulation of armor types. This involves the ability to create <b>multiple types of protection<\/b>, which can even react <b>differently to different ammunition types<\/b>. This opens the door to many new gameplay possibilities, and gives the player the option to select more efficient ammunition against a certain type of armor. And while we ourselves will be using this in a relatively modest way that is still understandable for the majority of players, the <b>possibilities<\/b> for the community creators <b>are virtually endless.<\/b>\"<\/i><br><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\">The armor values of Arma 3's vehicles are still being tweaked by our Encoders, but please feel free to already contribute your feedback to the <b><a href=\"https:\/\/forums.bohemia.net\/forums\/topic\/212427-vehicle-interiors-feedback\/\" target=\"_blank\">dedicated forums thread<\/a>.<\/b> Thanks!<br><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\"><div class=\"center-block\" style=\"max-width: 400px\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/_Asheara\/status\/966334029875367936\"><\/a><\/blockquote><\/div><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\">​<\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\">Last but not least, the ability to <b><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/VojtechKovaric\/status\/966334285698486272\" target=\"_blank\">customize the appearance<\/a><\/b> of armored vehicles is now also available on <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/dev-branch\" target=\"_blank\">Dev-Branch<\/a>.

However, with Tanks DLC on the way, we have yet to complete our current <a href=\"https:\/\/arma3.com\/news\/arma-3-roadmap-2016-17\" target=\"_blank\">roadmap<\/a> (Tanks DLC is on track to be released towards the end of Q1 2018). Beyond that, we feel it's important to already make clear that most of Arma 3's development team will start to transition onto other projects here at Bohemia Interactive. That means you should not expect any major new DLC or platform updates after Tanks DLC. Of course we'll most definitely <b>not<\/b> be abandoning the game. There will still be continued support for the game in the form of fixes and improvements. and we intend to share more information about the exact scope of this at a later date.

We have released <b>four DLC<\/b>, expanding the asset and feature scope beyond their original sizes. Starting off with <b><a href=\"https:\/\/arma3.com\/dlc\/jets\" target=\"_blank\">Jets DLC<\/a><\/b>, our goals were to introduce <b>new air superiority jets<\/b> and overhaul threat <b>detection and tracking<\/b>. And let's not forget the biggest asset of them all: the freely available <b>USS Freedom aircraft carrier<\/b> with its own suite of autonomous defensive systems. With these additions and many more, we wanted to improve gameplay across the entire sandbox, other vehicle categories included. This project was also an opportunity for us to test a cooperation between our company and a <b>third-party studio<\/b>, <i><a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/post\/oprep-jets-dlc\" target=\"_blank\">BRAVO ZERO ONE Studios<\/a><\/i>. We encountered some turbulent air during the flight, but the product turned out to be a supersonic addition!

Our freshly formed Amsterdam team put great effort into <b><a href=\"https:\/\/arma3.com\/dlc\/lawsofwar\" target=\"_blank\">Laws of War DLC<\/a><\/b>. In cooperation with the <i><a href=\"https:\/\/www.icrc.org\/en\" target=\"_blank\">International Committee of the Red Cross<\/a><\/i> (ICRC) and supported by many in the Bohemia Interactive family, they created an <b>immersive and deep package<\/b> of assets and content around the <a href=\"https:\/\/arma3.com\/ihl\" target=\"_blank\">International Humanitarian Law<\/a> (IHL) theme.

As IHL is a more serious topic and rarely referenced in games in general, we were happy to see the reactions and feedback coming back from the community and beyond. We'd also like to remind you that half of the net revenue made from direct Laws of War DLC purchases in 2017 will still be donated to the ICRC! Last, but certainly not least, we have recently released the <b><a href=\"https:\/\/arma3.com\/dlc\/tacops\" target=\"_blank\">Tac-Ops Mission Pack<\/a><\/b>. Taking a slightly different approach than the previous DLC, Tac-Ops mainly aims to please the <b>hardcore Arma singleplayer<\/b> fans.

As part of that, we're likely going to deploy a small hotfix to address some of the reported issues this or next week. Once that's done, we'll start cleaning up our internal systems, lifting data locks, going through the usual 'end of the year' organizational processes, while making sure Arma 3 rolls steady into the holiday season.<br><\/p><h3>INTELLIGENCE<br><\/h3><p>The anticipated <b><a href=\"https:\/\/arma3.com\/news\/arma-3-tac-ops-dlc-mission-pack-is-out-now\" target=\"_blank\">Arma 3 Tac-Ops Mission Pack<\/a><\/b> has been released! After months of hard work by our Design team, we're proud to finally deliver this package to players. With its focus on premium singleplayer mission content, Arma 3 Tac-Ops is a bit different from our other DLC, and we hope you'll enjoy this fresh singleplayer experience. Aside from the DLC itself, we've also introduced something new for Tac-Ops in the form of <b>After Action Report (AAR)<\/b> videos. These videos are presented by one of our military consultants, and offer practical insights on military tactics and combat as relevant to the Tac-Ops missions. You can read more about the Mission Pack <a href=\"https:\/\/arma3.com\/dlc\/tacops\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>, watch the <b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=HAC5peaIX1g\" target=\"_blank\">launch trailer<\/a><\/b>, or visit <a href=\"http:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/744950\/Arma_3_TacOps_Mission_Pack\/\" target=\"_blank\">Steam<\/a> or the <a href=\"https:\/\/store.bistudio.com\/products\/arma3-tacops\" target=\"_blank\">Bohemia Store<\/a> directly to make your purchase.

However, there were a few more additions included in the update. We'll talk about some of these in the Operations part of this report, but first let us discuss the ones that are related to the upcoming Tanks DLC. Vehicle enthusiasts might be interested in the <b><i>PhysX<\/i> library update<\/b>, which will help us improve the <b>handling of vehicles<\/b>. We're happy to report that <b>deadly bush and rock species<\/b> will no longer pose a threat like they used to. Unlike before, hitting them with your vehicle at higher speeds should no longer result in a fatal crash or orbital launch. Furthermore, when commanding an AI vehicle crew as commander, the <b>AI delay<\/b> should be almost non-existent. We hope this improvement will enable content creators to better incorporate vehicles into their scenarios!<br><\/p><p>Two nice bonuses in the update may have not caught your attention so far. All <b><a href=\"https:\/\/arma3.com\/apex\" target=\"_blank\">Apex<\/a> data<\/b> is now <b>decrypted<\/b> (converted to PBO), and <b>downloaded to all players<\/b>. This means community creators can now rely on all players having this data installed, and use it in their scenarios for example. It also means everyone's data is once again a single branch, making maintenance a little simpler and safer for us. It did cause the installation footprint for those who don't yet own Apex to grow a little. In addition, owners of various special editions of the game will now find translated versions of the <b>Malden topographic map (PDF)<\/b> in the <i>\"Bonus\"<\/i> subfolder of the game.<br><\/p><p>One of the changes turned out to be more problematic. As mentioned in the <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/post\/sitrep-00206\" target=\"_blank\">previous SITREP<\/a>, we've introduced a <b>BattlEye port change<\/b>, which we hoped would result in a smoother and more stable solution, especially for some of the community groups that were experiencing server issues. Unfortunately, its introduction did not exactly go as planned, despite our internal Quality Assurance efforts and almost two weeks of <a href=\"https:\/\/forums.bistudio.com\/forums\/topic\/183855-release-candidate-branch-announcements\/?tab=comments#comment-3250029\" target=\"_blank\">public Release Candidate testing<\/a>. It now appears that in some situations the <a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Arma_3_Dedicated_Server\" target=\"_blank\">Dedicated Server<\/a> refuses to use any game port other than the <b><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Arma3official\/status\/936606295070781440\" target=\"_blank\">default one<\/a><\/b> (2302). Needless to say, our programmers are <b>working on a solution<\/b> as we speak, which we hope to deploy later this week. Even though this low-level change didn't roll out as smoothly as we had hoped, the proposed direction should still be <b>beneficial<\/b> in the long run. For now, we apologize to everyone affected, and thank you for your understanding and patience!<br><\/p><p><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\"><div class=\"center-block\" style=\"max-width: 400px\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Arma3official\/status\/936253041417904129\"><\/a><\/blockquote><\/div><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\"><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\"><div class=\"center-block\" style=\"max-width: 400px\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Arma3official\/status\/936606295070781440\"><\/a><\/blockquote><\/div><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\">You can now nominate your favorite Arma 3 mods in the annual <b><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ModDB\/status\/936390039533076480\" target=\"_blank\">Mod of the Year Awards<\/a><\/b> hosted by <i><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ModDB\/\" target=\"_blank\">ModDB<\/a><\/i>!

Tac-Ops delivers three military operations (spread across seven missions) that aim to provide a true combat experience in an unrestricted war zone. The main branch a.k.a. the official release date is set to <b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bistudio.com\/blog\/arma-3-tac-ops-dlc-mission-pack-coming-on-november-30\" target=\"_blank\">November 30<\/a><\/b>.

As with everything on Dev-Branch, we're still aiming to <b>improve the experience<\/b> based on the reactions and observations from our community.<br><\/p><p>By the way, as some of you already noticed, all players will be <b>allowed to use premium assets<\/b> (such as <a href=\"https:\/\/arma3.com\/dlc\/marksmen\" target=\"_blank\">Marksmen<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/arma3.com\/apex\" target=\"_blank\">Apex<\/a> weapons) inside these operations, even if they don't own the respective DLC or expansion. Outside of the operations, standard content licensing applies. Aside from that, not yet available on Dev-Branch are the <b>After Action Report (AAR) videos<\/b>. Presented by one of our military consultants, British Army veteran Ash, you'll have the opportunity to re-visit the operations in short videos of around 7-8 minutes. In these videos, Ash will share his recommendations on how to best tackle the missions, and hopefully inspire you to have another go and try out a different approach. Currently we're looking to add the AAR videos to Dev-Branch closer to the full release on November 30.

Most love went to Tanoa's law enforcement <b><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Pajin\/status\/927896917476102144\" target=\"_blank\">Gendarmerie<\/a><\/b> faction, who now have transport and cargo <b>vans<\/b> in their motor pool. We've also added the ability to <b>toggle<\/b> between <b>vehicle and people transport<\/b> for the cargo variant.

That also includes Firing From Vehicles functionality from the side and rear doors. Please note that it's not technically possible to offer both at the same time, and there may be some glitches when applying this Virtual Garage component (<i>Add passenger spots<\/i>) and using it in Zeus.

Since this hotfix was primarily about improving the stability of the game, it meant that we only released updated game executables, which is why the size of the update (in terms of data) was rather lightweight. The full <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/post\/spotrep-00074\" target=\"_blank\"><b>SPOTREP<\/b><\/a> for the hotfix is available on the Arma 3 Dev Hub as per usual.<br><\/p><p><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\"><div class=\"center-block\" style=\"max-width: 400px\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Arma3official\/status\/915937583162683393\"><\/a><\/blockquote><\/div><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\">We also have some more information regarding a <i><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/TheBattlEye\" target=\"_blank\">BattlEye<\/a><\/i> mass-kicking, which happened to some communities over these past few months. It seems we finally found a <b>potential solution<\/b> to this problem with our senior programming staff working on it as we speak. However, it might still take us some time, because the changes require low-level and potentially risky netcode changes. For this reason the implementation and testing needs to be handled <b>with extreme care<\/b>. It means we don't have a specific date yet, but we hope to release the change in one of the upcoming Main Branch updates. Please bear with us!<br><\/p><h3>OPERATIONS<br><\/h3><p class=\"twitter-embed\">Now that things have taken a more final form, we're ready to share a bit more higher-level information on the upcoming <b>Arma 3 Tac-Ops DLC<\/b> (or, as we'll refer to it from now on, <b>Arma 3 Tac-Ops Mission Pack<\/b>). In short, Tac-Ops DLC will feature <b>three distinct singleplayer military operations<\/b>, and will offer at least 8+ hours of playtime depending on your playstyle and difficulty settings. The operations are designed for the seasoned Arma (single)player and aim to deliver a <b>\"classic Arma experience\"<\/b>. This translates into authentic combat situations in an open sandbox environment, where a thoughtful approach and patience are the key to success. We'll also be encouraging everyone to <b>replay<\/b> the operations. This is something we hope to achieve, and make rewarding, in a number of ways. For example, in some cases you'll have the opportunity to play the same mission from another unit's perspective. This, in turn, will grant you a better understanding of the operation as a whole. Another aspect is to present you with various (optional) objectives, and completing, failing, or ignoring these will influence the outcome of the wider operation. All in all, we plan to share much more specific intel on Arma 3 Tac-Ops (including its release date) in the beginning of November, which is also when the first operations should appear on <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/dev-branch\" target=\"_blank\">Dev-Branch<\/a>. However, we feel it's important to already make clear that the Tac-Ops Mission Pack <b>does not include new assets or platform features<\/b>. This is also reflected in the DLC's pricing, which is about half of a regular Arma 3 DLC (excluding the Apex expansion) at € 4.99 \/ $ 5.99 \/ £ 4.49. Ultimately, we believe that this, in combination with excellent singleplayer content, makes for a splendid package. We can't wait to launch Tac-Ops and hear about your successes (and failures) on the battlefield!<br><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\">Speaking of splendid packages on our <a href=\"https:\/\/arma3.com\/news\/arma-3-roadmap-2016-17\" target=\"_blank\">2017 Roadmap<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/dev-branch\" target=\"_blank\">Dev-Branch<\/a> was recently updated with a first batch of the <b>platform improvements<\/b> planned for the upcoming <b>Tanks DLC<\/b>. For example, you can now try out the <b><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ondrejkuzel\/status\/917749684982157314\" target=\"_blank\">Driving Overhaul<\/a><\/b> for tracked vehicles on the Kuma Main Battle Tank. The goal of this Driving Overhaul was to make handling, power, gears, and overall control of your vehicle correspond better with real life situations. Many of these changes were made possible thanks to the recent update of our game's <i>PhysX<\/i> libraries. Designer <i><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ondrejkuzel\" target=\"_blank\">Ondřej Kužel<\/a><\/i> is now collecting feedback <a href=\"https:\/\/forums.bistudio.com\/forums\/topic\/211039-tanks-tracked-vehicles-driving-and-handling\/\" target=\"_blank\">on the forums<\/a>, and the next step is to bring all tracked vehicles to the level of Kuma for Arma 3's <b>next Main Branch update<\/b>! Another major improvement, which is also deployed to <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/dev-branch\" target=\"_blank\">Dev-Branch<\/a>, is the <b>Vehicle Audio Overhaul<\/b>. In this case, our Audio Ninjas used new technology to equip the Kuma tank with more as well as <b>new audio samples<\/b>, while the calculation\/computing of the engine's RPM has been overhauled as well. All in all, we plan to keep on introducing more overhauled vehicles to Dev-Branch as soon as they're ready and tested. By the way, <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/dev-branch\" target=\"_blank\">Dev-Branch<\/a> users might have spotted one other, small but visually appealing, tweak: heavy vehicles now simulate <b><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ssnd292\/status\/918793989830127616\" target=\"_blank\">recoil<\/a> when firing their main guns!<\/b><br><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\"><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\"><div class=\"center-block\" style=\"max-width: 400px\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ondrejkuzel\/status\/917749684982157314\"><\/a><\/blockquote><\/div><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\"><\/p><p class=\"twitter-embed\"><div class=\"center-block\" style=\"max-width: 400px\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ssnd292\/status\/918793989830127616\"><\/a><\/blockquote><\/div><\/p><h3>LOGISTICS<br><\/h3><p class=\"twitter-embed\">Last week we posted a new job advert for \"<b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bistudio.com\/company\/careers\/48\" target=\"_blank\">Community Manager<\/a><\/b>\" for <b>Arma 3<\/b> on the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bistudio.com\/company\/careers\" target=\"\">Bohemia careers website<\/a>.

Since not everybody has time to track these changes between main-branch updates, let's take a look at some recent highlights.<\/p> <ul> <li>Audio Designer <em>Tom de Smit<\/em> already worked on asset-specific SFX for explosives used in Laws of War DLC. Now he has also added such placement, defusal and trigger sounds for the remainder of explosives (except for naval mines). <\/li> <li>Picture-in-Picture render targets (e.g. vehicle rear view mirrors) can and do now use <a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Arma_3_Cars_Config_Guidelines#Picture_in_Picture_for_screens_and_mirrors\" target=\"_blank\">occlusion bounding boxes<\/a> for improved performance.

The update alone should deliver an improved simulation of tracked vehicle driving, but stay tuned for our work-in-progress tweaks to specific assets, also using new parameters that will be documented. <\/li> <li>Many of the engine's script commands now throw a script error (shown if enabled) in case incorrect enum(erated) values are provided.

My name is Pavel Valič, and I'm an Artist at Bohemia Interactive's relatively new office in the Netherlands. Over the past year or so I've been one of the people responsible for the new assets in the Arma 3 Laws of War DLC. Now I have the honor to tell you a little bit more about what our team has created for you. In this OPREP, we'll specifically focus on the art side of things, and talk about the new assets and discuss how they were created.<\/p> <h2>LAWS OF ART<\/h2> <p>First, let me establish the ORBAT (Order of Battle), or in this case ORBART, for the Laws of War project. Our Art team consisted of two in-house artists in the Amsterdam office, and several splendid 3D and Technical Artists in our Mníšek pod Brdy office in the Czech Republic. In addition, our colleagues in the Bohemia Interactive's Thailand office were on hand to help with many of the 'props'.<\/p> <p>In terms of the scope of the project, our original goal was to make the Laws of War DLC stand somewhere in between <a href=\"https:\/\/arma3.com\/dlc\/karts\" target=\"_blank\">Arma 3 Karts<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/arma3.com\/dlc\/helicopters\" target=\"_blank\">Arma 3 Helicopters DLC<\/a>. During the pre-production phase, we started by establishing a wishlist of key new assets that we wanted in the package. Then we had to prioritize our wishes based on our available resources, and by anticipating the potential risks and costs involved with developing certain assets. With all those considerations in mind, we reached a final wishlist, and it was time to flex our artistic muscles properly!<\/p> <p>However, at that time we had not yet completely settled on the exact theme of the DLC. Once this became more clear, and also while the mini-campaign and Showcases scenarios started to come together, we ended up making many more assets and variants than on our original wishlist. The reason being that we felt they were simply too important not to include in the package. For reference, the photo below on the left shows what assets were originally on the list, while the photo on the right shows what it ultimately became. But let's talk specifics!<\/p> <p class=\"text-center\"> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/oprep_idap_art.png\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/oprep_idap_art.png\" class=\"img-responsive\" height=\"\" width=\"\"><\/a> <\/p> <h2>IDAP<\/h2> <p class=\"text-center\"> <img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/oprep_idap_logo.png\" class=\"img-responsive\"> <\/p> <p>One of the key new additions in the Laws of War DLC is the <strong>IDAP<\/strong> faction (International Development &amp; Aid Project - a name and corresponding acronym we settled on after plenty of iterations, seen in the image below). This humanitarian organization is very much inspired by similar real-world NGO's, such as the ICRC. Although IDAP is fictional, in terms of its visual representation, we still wanted to make it look authentic and believable. Our new artist in Amsterdam, <em>Stefan Verbeek<\/em> (some of you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/arma\/comments\/5joa0p\/pay_for_custom_face\/\" target=\"_blank\">might know him from reddit<\/a>), accepted this challenge.<\/p> <p class=\"text-center\"> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/oprep_idap_icons.png\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/oprep_idap_icons.png\" class=\"img-responsive\" height=\"\" width=\"\"><\/a> <\/p> <p>Of course every organization needs a logo, and especially for an NGO, that needs to be something that is instantly recognizable. As you can see above, the IDAP logo clearly represents the organization's mission via the holding hands, which can be interpreted as a symbol of help and relief. The wings and the white embody the purity of IDAP's ideals, while the orange color is of course easily recognizable in conflict zones, and serves as a tribute to the country where the DLC was developed (and the original codename for the project).<\/p> <p class=\"text-center\"> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/oprep_idap_vehicles.png\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/oprep_idap_vehicles.png\" class=\"img-responsive\" height=\"\" width=\"\"><\/a> <\/p> <p>In terms of new assets, IDAP is composed of branded character outfits, and a range of wheeled and propelled vehicles. To create the new assets and textures, we collected as much reference imagery as we could find online, but we were also fortunate enough to have the opportunity to consult with our contacts at ICRC. They were able to help us get all of the finer details right, such as the iconography and improvised decals on the vehicles. They also mentioned the addition of stickers to make it very clear to everyone that their vehicles and camps do not contain weapons. Perhaps most importantly they stressed the need for clear markings on the roofs, so that (military) air assets would correctly identify them. However, to better explain the (art) development process, let's take a closer look at each of these assets individually.<\/p> <h2>VAN<\/h2> <p>The main asset in the Laws of War DLC is probably the Van. The model was created by our veteran artist in the Czech Republic: <em>Mario Kurty<\/em>. At first glance, it probably looks like a vehicle you know. In fact, our main source of inspiration was the Mercedes-Benz Sprinter. Combined with that we also wanted to make the van design be in line with the rest of the game's 2035 civilian wheeled vehicles. In terms of functionality, a van is typically used for many different purposes. That's why we created each main part of the vehicle to be reusable in different ways, just like a real-life car manufacturer would do. That allowed us to develop 3 different van types: cargo, transport, and ambulance.<\/p> <p class=\"text-center\"> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/oprep_idap_vehicles_2.png\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/oprep_idap_vehicles_2.png\" class=\"img-responsive\" height=\"\" width=\"\"><\/a> <\/p> <p>To better explain how that works, when you look carefully at the model, you can see that the window area on the transport van is the same as the ambulance, but the latter uses a different surface material. However, even though re-usability is a great thing, we still wanted to have some unique things for each van variant. For example, the cargo van has quite common rims, whereas the transport van has sexy\/shiny aluminium ones. The ambulance in particular has lots of unique parts, especially with regards to its interior. On top of all that, the introduction of the van means there are new passenger positions, which means it needed new animations. This is necessary because every vehicle\/car has different seats with different heights and backrest angles.<\/p> <p class=\"text-center\"> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/oprep_idap_van.png\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/oprep_idap_van.png\" class=\"img-responsive\" height=\"\" width=\"\"><\/a> <\/p> <p>In terms of functionality, we paid special attention to the van's interior, but we also added lots of customization options for the vehicle as a whole. In Eden Editor, you can open and\/or slide doors in, add protectors, a ladder, roof rack, spare wheel, or switch on the emergency lights. Furthermore, you can even transport quad bikes or the new utility drones, and there are three different shooting positions for passengers. Modders may also wish to apply custom dynamic textures to the various interior monitors. This splendid functionality was achieved by our new Technical Artist (and one of the developers of the RHS mod - winner of <a href=\"http:\/\/makearmanotwar.com\/entry\/DT5ghVA5GT#.Wa63o8gjFaQ\" target=\"_blank\">Make Arma Not War modding contest<\/a>), <em><a href=\"https:\/\/forums.bistudio.com\/profile\/750123-reyhard\/\" target=\"_blank\">Maciej Pham<\/a><\/em>. Ah, and also be sure to honk the 'horn' while you're driving the ambulance! Overall, there's lots to like, and we hope you'll appreciate this level of detail. Special shout-out to <em><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/A3_Melle\" target=\"_blank\">Melle<\/a><\/em> for giving us the opportunity to inspect this type of vehicle in real life! <br><\/p> <p class=\"text-center\"> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/oprep_idap_van_photos.png\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/oprep_idap_van_photos.png\" class=\"img-responsive\" height=\"\" width=\"\"><\/a> <\/p> <p>Aside from the model and functionality, one new technical improvement with the van was the possibility to use 4096x4096 pixel resolution textures. This is great because it meant we could increase the level of detail of small objects in the interior. Speaking of textures, the van comes with many different liveries, but if would you like to create your own, we've prepared <a href=\"http:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/390500\/Arma_3_Samples\/\" target=\"_blank\">Photoshop template files<\/a> so you can create custom paint jobs. As a showcase, we prepared and de-livery'd a recreation of the so-called 'Arma 3 <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pcgamer.com\/pc-gamers-terrifying-battle-bus-is-why-you-should-play-arma-2\/\" target=\"_blank\">Battle Bus<\/a>', which some of you have seen before driving around Prague, or reported on social media.<\/p> <p class=\"text-center\"> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/oprep_idap_van.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/oprep_idap_van.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\" height=\"\" width=\"\"><\/a> <\/p> <h2>UTILITY &amp; DEMINING DRONE<\/h2> <p>One other new piece of technology is the Utility &amp; Demining Drone. Just like the van, there are different variants of this drone as well. The (military) 'cargo' variant was named after the pelican; a well-known bird species, which is famous for being able to hold an incredible amount of water in their beak. In our case, the beak is a big plastic box that can be used to deliver small objects. The same utility drone, but dressed in very vivid colors resembling an ambulance, enables you to heal and take out medical supplies. I can imagine some cool combat missions in which your squad under fire receives medical aid by drone. <\/p> <p class=\"text-center\"> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/oprep_idap_drones.png\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/oprep_idap_drones.png\" class=\"img-responsive\" height=\"\" width=\"\"><\/a> <\/p> <p>Lastly, IDAP uses a stripped variant of the drone, which can carry up to four small explosive charges that can be released remotely to trigger mines and sometimes even start a chain reaction. While we don't limit how you use this variant, we did add colored smoke and a whistle sound to make it clear this is more of an engineering tool, rather than a weapon. As this drone is customized by IDAP itself, we tried to make this variant look as something that was made in a garage rather than by a product designer. Its special mine detection ring can identify explosives up to 50 meters away, which also required us to add engine support for custom Mine Detectors in vehicles.<\/p> <p class=\"text-center\"> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/oprep_idap_drones_2.png\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/oprep_idap_drones_2.png\" class=\"img-responsive\" height=\"\" width=\"\"><\/a> <\/p> <p>One source of inspiration for the drone was an interesting prototype concept from the Technical University in Delft, the Netherlands. At the same time, we've looked at other existing working drone concepts, which funnily enough serve some very <a href=\"http:\/\/unmannedcargo.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">interesting purposes<\/a> (including pizza delivery!). As for the visual language, we modeled the Pelican to make it look as if it came from the same product line as Arma 3's original Darter drone. However, we felt that we needed to represent the fact that this drone has more lifting power by adding 6 propellers to its somewhat chubby body. Based on our research, it also made sense to add protectors around the blades to prevent damage. Plus, in my opinion, it makes the drone more unique and interesting. By the way, we've also prepared a livery template for the drone, so I look forward to seeing some community-made beer transport drones soon!<\/p> <h2>CHARACTER OUTFITS &amp; GEAR<\/h2> <p>The Laws of War DLC also includes many new assets for players to wear. There are new character outfits including those for our IDAP workers (many of these outfits are actually available for free to all Arma 3 players). Then there are things like newly modeled bags, vests, headsets, hard and press helmets, different hats, eye protectors. And more gear was added as newly re-textured variants of platform free assets.<\/p> <p class=\"text-center\"> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/oprep_idap_chars.png\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/oprep_idap_chars.png\" class=\"img-responsive\" height=\"\" width=\"\"><\/a> <\/p> <p>Many of these new assets were inspired by real-life references we could find online, and in the case of the IDAP clothing, we even received some pointers from our contacts at the ICRC. However, sometimes searching for references is less pleasant, such as with the head bandage, and, as you might imagine, the blood pools. Most of these assets are created also in several color variants to make them suitable to wear on different terrains like Tanoa or Altis.<\/p> <p class=\"text-center\"> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/oprep_idap_head_gear.png\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/oprep_idap_head_gear.png\" class=\"img-responsive\" height=\"\" width=\"\"><\/a> <\/p> <p>In terms of the development, the creation of thin character clothing such as the safety and multi-pocket vest required more care in skinning for animation. The same issue applied to the messenger bag and the leg strap beg, which did end up looking very distinct from previous Arma 3 gear. Unfortunately, when creating these assets, we sometimes also run into issues that were not foreseen. For example, the original protective helmet for the EOD specialist featured a large protective face shield. This is what's used in the real world to offer 'better' protection. However, in our situation, this led to a problem where the protective shield would clip through the character when using the raising weapon animations. It was a limitation we couldn't resolve on a technical level, and we didn't want to break the immersion, which is why we opted for the protective goggles instead. Due to issues such as these, we sometimes either had to redesign or decide to cancel such objects, like in this particular case.<\/p> <p class=\"text-center\"> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/oprep_idap_body_gear.png\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/oprep_idap_body_gear.png\" class=\"img-responsive\" height=\"\" width=\"\"><\/a> <\/p> <h2>DECORATIVE OBJECTS<\/h2> <p>But there's more! And it's all FREE for every Arma 3 player. To deliver immersive official playable content, and to enable the community to create more diverse content, we prepared a wide variety static decorative objects (also referred to as 'props'). These were mostly produced with the help of our skilled colleagues from Thailand, and really complement the new IDAP faction overall.<\/p> <p class=\"text-center\"> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/oprep_idap_objects.png\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/oprep_idap_objects.png\" class=\"img-responsive\" height=\"\" width=\"\"><\/a> <\/p> <p>IDAP is a humanitarian organization that provides aid to affected areas. This can be in the form of medical but also material aid. For this reason, we added many cardboard boxes, pallets with water bottles, shiny thermal blankets, but also more 'grim' items such as body bags. As mentioned before, doing the research and collecting photographic references for some of these items could be a bit disturbing. One of largest new objects is definitely the shelter tent, which comes in many variants. Fun fact: the modeling and texturing of the tent was done by our artist, Stan - and 'stan' happens to be Czech word for 'tent'. You can imagine the fun we had. Compliments to Stan_F (insiders will understand) for his splendid work!<\/p> <p class=\"text-center\"> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/oprep_idap_tent.png\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/oprep_idap_tent.png\" class=\"img-responsive\" height=\"\" width=\"\"><\/a> <\/p> <p>Rumor also has it that some furniture has finally returned to the island of Altis. Lucky for us, because our splendid Senior Designer <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/KarelMoricky\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Karel Mořický<\/em><\/a> was able to make the campaign much more interesting by adding interiors and custom compositions to the town of Oreokastro. The power of the Eden Editor once again showed. It also showed that not only modeling new assets can enrich the game, but also combining existing ones or putting things together (or partially hiding them in the ground) can create something new. While exploring the town in \"Remnants of War\", you may have noticed that by flipping props like the bed upside down, you can suddenly have closets!<\/p> <p class=\"text-center\"> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/oprep_idap_furn.png\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/oprep_idap_furn.png\" class=\"img-responsive\" height=\"\" width=\"\"><\/a> <\/p> <h2>MINE DISPENSER<\/h2> <p>Even though this OPREP is primarily focused on IDAP, there are more new assets we're adding with the Laws of War DLC. As these affect IDAP's day-to-day operations, I'd like to discuss one of them here: APERS Mine Dispenser. This piece of weaponry is inspired by the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.textronsystems.com\/what-we-do\/weapon-sensor-systems\/spider\" target=\"_blank\">Spider mine system<\/a>, but was changed to be a portable device that fits in your backpack and can be assembled swiftly. The Mine Dispenser holds 2 mini-mines in 7 tubes. On touch off, which can be triggered remotely, these mines are thrown in a wide angle and cover about 25 square meters. Yep, this is a nasty device indeed.<\/p> <p class=\"text-center\"> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/oprep_idap_mines.png\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/oprep_idap_mines.png\" class=\"img-responsive\" height=\"\" width=\"\"><\/a> <\/p> <p>The Mine Dispenser model itself was designed from scratch. To determine the basic appearance of this device, we had to look at its requirements. We knew that the Mine Dispenser would need to be easily transferable, have a reasonable weight, and it would need to be radio-controlled. Using an iterative approach, which works best when working on fictional items, we started with some primitive shapes. We then discussed whether the conditions were met and if the device looked convincing enough. After we settled on the shape, one of the artist started to work on a more detailed model. This procedure included multiple iterations as well. Since soldiers need to be able to carry the Mine Dispenser on the battlefield, we also needed to prepare the art for an inventory version of Mine Dispenser. As you can see, we've made it look like a small bag, which can be placed into a larger backpack. The image above shows how the Mine Dispenser can be folded.<\/p> <p class=\"text-center\"> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/oprep_idap_mines_2.png\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/oprep_idap_mines_2.png\" class=\"img-responsive\" height=\"\" width=\"\"><\/a> <\/p> <p>All in all, I hope this OPREP gives a little bit more insight into the development process of the new assets. There are plenty more to discuss, such as the unique Training Mine and new Cluster Bombs, but we'll leave that for another time. We're quite satisfied with how it all turned out, and I believe that they will contribute a lot to the game - both in terms of the sandbox environment, but also in the, in my opinion, amazing campaign, very cool showcases, and challenging time trials. I want to thank all our players who always help to pump creativity into our brains so we can make Arma 3 even better!<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Pajin\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Pavel Valič<\/em><\/a><br>Artist<\/p>","created_at":"2017-09-14 13:31:59","excerpt":"<p>Laws of Art: examining the IDAP faction and its assets<\/p>","id":356,"post_header_image":null,"post_thumb":null,"public_date":"2017-09-14 13:31:00","published":"1","title":"OPREP - IDAP","type":"oprep","updated_at":"2017-09-14 14:19:01","url":"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/post\/oprep-idap"},{"animation_interval":200,"author":"Joris-Jan van 't Land","content":"<p>FROM: High Command<br> TO: Arma 3 Users<br> UNIT: Main Branch<br> ACTIVITY: Game Update 1.76 (Laws of War DLC, Mine Detector Enhancements)<br> SIZE: ~9.0 GB \/ ~1.4 GB (depends on Apex ownership)<\/p> <h1>NOTES<\/h1> <ul> <li>Consider using the Steam client option to verify the integrity of the local game cache to avoid corrupted data after downloading this update. <\/li> <li>Consider defragmenting your HDD after downloading large updates.<\/li> <li>Updating a deeply moddable game and its platform is not without risks.

Senior Designer <i>Jiří Wainar<\/i> introduces the new modules: <i>\"Both modules are really nice in terms of clarity - changes you do in Eden Editor are <b>directly translated into the scenario<\/b>. The first module is called <b><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/VojtechKovaric\/status\/904998686459129856\" target=\"_blank\">Edit Terrain Object<\/a><\/b>. It controls various aspects of a single terrain object. As you place it into the scenario, <b>it detects the nearest terrain object<\/b> that matches its object type filter. By adjusting the filters you can make the module <b>detect and snap<\/b> only for example to vegetation. The detected object is framed by a <b>pink bounding box<\/b>. If there is no such bounding box, there is no valid object matching the selected object type filter. The second module is <b>Hide Terrain Objects<\/b>. It allows for <b>hiding multiple terrain objects at once<\/b>. What will be hidden is controlled by an object type filter (the same as used in the 'Edit Terrain Object' module) and by the actual module area. The module area can be adjusted directly in the <b>3D scene<\/b> by <b>Area Scaling Widget<\/b> (keybind: 4) and <b>Area Widget<\/b> (keybind: 5) that are present on the top horizontal toolbox.

The Amsterdam team itself, 8 strong, led development and handled a large part of Design and Art production.<\/p> <p class=\"text-center\"> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/a3_oprep_low_team1.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"Most members of the small Amsterdam team\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/a3_oprep_low_team1.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\" height=\"\" width=\"\"><\/a> <\/p> <p>\"Orange\" DLC had several high-level goals for us:<\/p> <ul> <li><strong>Explore<\/strong> a different perspective on the battlefield<\/li> <li><strong>Expand<\/strong> the Arma 3 platform and sandbox with fun and useful additions<\/li> <li><strong>Train<\/strong> a new development team in Amsterdam<\/li> <\/ul> <p>The <strong>scope<\/strong> was set somewhere between <a href=\"https:\/\/arma3.com\/dlc\/karts\" target=\"_blank\">Karts DLC<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/arma3.com\/dlc\/helicopters\" target=\"_blank\">Helicopters DLC<\/a>, and we would focus on <strong>assets primarily<\/strong>. This was a product of the available team members, time, and other resources. Over the course of development, we expanded our plans for <strong>playable content<\/strong> the most. And it became possible to get a handful of feature enhancements in as well. Now that we're close to the end of development, we can say that it's a much larger package than we had planned, but also one we're very proud of. Hopefully this OPREP will help to explain why we believe it contains something meaningful to everyone.<\/p> <p>So how did we arrive to the Laws of War DLC? We did <strong>conceptualize<\/strong> around 10 other <strong>high-concepts<\/strong>, based on our own internal wishlists and backlogs, <a href=\"https:\/\/feedback.bistudio.com\/project\/view\/1\/\" target=\"_blank\">Feedback Tracker<\/a> entries, <a href=\"https:\/\/forums.bistudio.com\/forums\/forum\/218-arma-3\/\" target=\"_blank\">forums discussions<\/a>, and a lot of other research. Ultimately we dropped most of these concepts for reasons such as simply not having the capacity to deliver complex new features with this project. Driven by our first goal of wanting to play from another perspective, we quite soon concluded the package would center around some kind of <strong>non-combatant<\/strong> role or faction in war zones. You would still be in an armed conflict, but not necessarily as part of a military. Admittedly, this was also the direction that we simply <em>wanted<\/em> to work on from the team's personal creative perspectives.<\/p><p> <div class=\"video-wrapper\" id=\"DwU0Hnch_28\"><div class=\"absolute-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=DwU0Hnch_28\" data-video=\"DwU0Hnch_28\" data-container=\".video-wrapper#DwU0Hnch_28\" data-removeitem=\".video-wrapper#DwU0Hnch_28 .btn\" class=\"btn btn-play\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-play\"><\/span><\/a><\/div><img src=\"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/DwU0Hnch_28\/maxresdefault.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"><\/div> <\/p><p>We began production on several assets that we knew would fit all of our remaining concepts. At the same time we started experimenting with playable content prototypes, that were intended to show off the assets, and to bring it all together. It wasn't for some time that we truly solidified the theme, name and full concept for the DLC. A long-term working relationship with a special organization provided the final piece of the puzzle ...<\/p> <h2>INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW<\/h2> <p>For several years Bohemia Interactive has been in direct contact with the <strong>International Committee of the Red Cross<\/strong> (<strong>ICRC<\/strong>). This organization, and the many national Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, are probably known to most of you. As part of their humanitarian activities, they seek to explain, implement and safeguard <strong>International Humanitarian Law<\/strong> (<strong>IHL<\/strong>), also known as the laws of armed conflict, the rules of war, the laws of war, or jus in bello. IHL is perhaps most well known through the Geneva Conventions. Our collaboration began with more ad-hoc advise from one of their IHL specialists, <em>Christian Rouffaer<\/em>, to our very own Creative Bohemian <em><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/IvanBuchta\" target=\"_blank\">Ivan Buchta<\/a><\/em>. Having been drawn to the Arma series because of its inherently more authentic depiction of war, Christian identified us as a good starting point in games. He would offer tips on specific parts of IHL, which in some cases lead to tweaks to the Arma 2 \/ 3 sandboxes. The correct use of the Red Crystal on unarmed military medical vehicles was one clear example of this.<\/p> <p>During the development of Arma 3, Christian and one of his colleagues visited us in the Czech Republic. Together they presented to us the basics of IHL and we had an open discussion on how we might represent it in our games. Later we were also invited to speak on this topic during a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gdcvault.com\/play\/1022009\/Gaming-the-Laws-of-War\" target=\"_blank\">panel at GDC<\/a> in San Francisco. The ICRC's pragmatic approach to the complex topic has always inspired us. They immediately made it clear to us that their intention was <em>not<\/em> to remove 'fun' from our games, or to restrict and punish players. They merely sought to offer ideas to <strong>spread awareness<\/strong> of this highly relevant aspect of war, and brainstormed with us on how we could incorporate it in gameplay.<\/p><p> <div class=\"img-wrapper\"> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/a3_oprep_low_icrc1.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-3\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"Christian Rouffaer (ICRC) presents IHL basics to the Arma 3 design team\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/a3_oprep_low_icrc1.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\" height=\"\" width=\"\"><\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/a3_oprep_low_icrc2.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-3\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"Christan Rouffaer (ICRC) engages in game design discussion related to IHL\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/a3_oprep_low_icrc2.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\" height=\"\" width=\"\"><\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/a3_oprep_low_screen4.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-3\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"An in-game representation of a similar IHL workshop in Showcase Laws of War\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/a3_oprep_low_screen4.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\" height=\"\" width=\"\"><\/a> <\/div> <\/p><p>It's important to stress to players that we have <em>not<\/em> and will <strong><em>not<\/em> be limiting the player freedom you know in Arma 3<\/strong>. There will not be new punishments when you do violate IHL, unless a specific scenario revolves around it. Rather, we've wanted to present warfare from a lot of different perspectives, and let you form an opinion yourselves. We see this rather as adding an extra layer of depth for authenticity. Knowledge of IHL \/ LOAC is key for any modern military after all. That is translated to Rules of Engagement (ROE) for missions. This is not to say it's not without controversy either. The situation on the ground can be extremely difficult for soldiers and civilians alike. This duality is also something we hope to showcase to some degree. Put another way, it's not our aim to make you feel bad for playing Arma 3. This project is about raising awareness and focusing on an aspect of war that is once again extremely relevant these days.<\/p><p> <div class=\"img-wrapper\"> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/a3_oprep_low_leaflet2.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-3\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"In-game IHL leaflet by IDAP\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/a3_oprep_low_leaflet2.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\" height=\"\" width=\"\"><\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/a3_oprep_low_leaflet1.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-3\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"In-game IHL leaflet by IDAP\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/a3_oprep_low_leaflet1.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\" height=\"\" width=\"\"><\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/a3_oprep_low_leaflet3.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-3\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"In-game IHL leaflet by IDAP\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/a3_oprep_low_leaflet3.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\" height=\"\" width=\"\"><\/a> <\/div> <\/p><p>All of this clicked together with our non-combatants perspective very well. We started to really shape the package based on our existing plans, the things we knew we'd be able to deliver, and consultation from the ICRC. We looked at parts of Arma that already related to IHL, such as the existing <strong>Renegade-mechanic<\/strong>, which (rather bluntly) handles with deliberate killing of unlawful targets. And, together with a lot of research of IHL reference materials, we picked some <strong>key topics<\/strong> to focus on: <strong>humanitarian aid<\/strong>, <strong>landmines<\/strong>, other <strong>Explosive Remnants of War<\/strong> (<strong>ERW<\/strong>), and <strong>cluster munitions<\/strong>. Of course there are other important aspects of real-world IHL, but we had to remain realistic about what would be possible to produce.<\/p> <p><strong>IHL<\/strong> is not only <strong>complicated<\/strong>, but also <strong>evolving<\/strong> alongside the nature of warfare. It's hard to cover all of it correctly in a game. We've experimented with some sandbox systems that would optionally provide direct feedback on IHL violations, but quickly decided that was not the way to go. Instead, we would build assets and playable content that try to cover the basics and highlight the most important components. We've included a <strong>free Showcase \"Laws of War\"<\/strong> for everyone that was actually inspired by the ICRC presentation to us. This is the most instructional element of the DLC, together with a set of relevant <strong>Field Manual entries<\/strong>. It's also important to state that we ourselves are not IHL legal experts, but we've done our best to make sure the information is accurate. The ICRC has helped us with this by proof-reading the relevant materials and proposing corrections. But the game remains a secondary source of information on the topic. Visit <a href=\"https:\/\/arma3.com\/ihl\" target=\"_blank\">this page<\/a> for some links to full and up-to-date references for further study.<\/p> <p>It was also decided early on that we would not represent the ICRC directly in the game. Instead, we crafted a fictional Armaverse Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) named the <strong>International Development &amp; Aid Project<\/strong> (<strong>IDAP<\/strong>). This was done to avoid any potential undesired real-world reflections on the ICRC's good work, as well us having more creative freedom with the faction. While designing our faction, its mission and 'branding' were inspired by several real NGOs operating in conflict areas. Discussions with the ICRC and our own research allowed us to incorporate some nice authentic touches, such as the no-weapons symbology on vehicles and visible markings on asset roofs against aerial targeting.<\/p> <p class=\"text-center\"> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/a3_oprep_low_screen5.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"IDAP aid workers speaking near a small aid camp\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/a3_oprep_low_screen5.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\" height=\"\" width=\"\"><\/a> <\/p> <p>Linking back to the real world, we're happy to be in a position where we can provide some support back to the ICRC's efforts. Half of Bohemia Interactive's net revenue from direct sales (not as part of bundles) of the Arma 3 Laws of War DLC during 2017 will be <strong>donated<\/strong> to them. We will announce the total amount in 2018, but would already like to thank players for their contributions by supporting the DLC. In case you were wondering why we revealed the DLC so late in development. It was partly due to this collaboration with the ICRC, for which it was important to agree on the plans and our communications together. Again, we want to make sure we respect their real-world work and represent IHL as best we can.<\/p><p> <div class=\"img-wrapper\"> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/a3_oprep_low_amsterdam4.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-2\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"Brand &amp; PR Manager Korneel skillfully demonstrates a concept for the DLC artwork\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/a3_oprep_low_amsterdam4.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\" height=\"\" width=\"\"><\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/a3_oprep_low_artwork.jpg\" class=\"img-thumbnail-2\" data-toggle=\"lightbox\" target=\"_blank\" data-gallery=\"gallery\" data-title=\"The final Laws of War artwork\" data-parent=\".post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dev.arma3.com\/assets\/img\/post\/images\/thumbs\/a3_oprep_low_artwork.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\" height=\"\" width=\"\"><\/a> <\/div> <\/p><h2>FEATURES<\/h2> <p>As we stated earlier, we knew from the start that this project would <em>not<\/em> see extensive <strong>feature<\/strong> additions.

It was used for special cluster artillery shells. This was now extended to also allow for aircraft cluster bombs, and so we've added such bombs for each major faction. Perhaps more importantly, we wanted to do something with a very nasty consequence of these destructive weapons, but not remove such weapons from the game. Not all bomblets detonate on impact and get left behind for years after they were deployed, effectively turning into landmines. This effect is now simulated for cluster munitions, so you may encounter faction-specific <strong>Unexploded Ordnance<\/strong> (<strong>UXO<\/strong>) with varying detonation behaviors. In addition we've done some small tweaks to the relevant sound and visual effects. <\/li> <li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/forums.bistudio.com\/forums\/topic\/209195-laws-of-war-dlc-mines\/\" target=\"_blank\">Mines<\/a><\/strong> - Arma 3 already had mines and means of detection and removal. While we didn't want to drastically change these mechanics at this stage in the game's life, we did want to deepen the gameplay a touch. There is now a greater emphasis on manually revealing landmines and other ERW. The 2035 detection technology is still more advanced than what you might encounter today, but you'll have to rely more on your <strong>Mine Detector<\/strong> and new audio cues. This change should also be more compatible with difficulty settings that disable the in-game danger icons, by letting those players still get clues from the new Info Panel. Furthermore, the new <strong>Demining Drone<\/strong> can both detect ERW effectively as well as clear it using special charges. And that's a good thing, especially given the new <strong>APERS Mine Dispenser<\/strong> weapon that's capable to creating a dangerous mess very quickly. <\/li> <li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/forums.bistudio.com\/forums\/topic\/209197-laws-of-war-dlc-leaflets\/\" target=\"_blank\">Leaflets<\/a><\/strong> - scenario designers can use the <strong>scripted<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Arma_3_Leaflets\" target=\"_blank\">leaflets system<\/a> in a variety of ways. They can set up drones to drop (custom) leaflets for players to read, or pre-place them in scenarios. Did you know that such leaflet drops have been used by armed forces in the real world for a long time? Even today they are used to warn civilian populations of impending attacks, but also to spread misinformation. The system can also be used more generically, for example to inspect the info signs in <strong>Faction Showcase \"IDAP\"<\/strong>. <\/li> <\/ul> <h2>VALUE<\/h2> <p>Unlike some of our other DLC, we knew that it would be more <strong>challenging to explain<\/strong> what precisely you'd be getting with Laws of War DLC. When we have something like <a href=\"https:\/\/arma3.com\/dlc\/helicopters\" target=\"_blank\">Helicopters<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/arma3.com\/dlc\/jets\" target=\"_blank\">Jets<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=C9bCFJ5z1vk\" target=\"_blank\">Tanks<\/a> DLC, sure enough, you'll get those vehicles. We also picked a more sensitive topic that we wanted to treat with as much respect as possible. Hopefully our various communications on the project after its reveal have showed off what it's all about, but in case you're still wondering, let's take a look at how different types of players can benefit:<\/p> <ul> <li><strong>General<\/strong> - the singleplayer mini-campaign offers a different approach to narrative gameplay in Arma 3, while also exposing a lot of the key parts of the theme. Depending on your play-style, you will probably spend around 3 hours in and around the town of Oreokastro on Altis. People enjoying the Armaverse lore will find plenty to things to uncover! Together with the Showcases and bonus Time Trials, you're looking at a decent amount of curated fun out of the box. <\/li> <li><strong>Mil-sim<\/strong> - the IDAP humanitarian faction, new weapon systems, simulation of UXO, medical tents, medical utility drones, and all new props will let <a href=\"https:\/\/units.arma3.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">units<\/a> more easily add these authentic parts of war to their operations. They may be inspired to run some ops with a focus on LOAC (many units actually already do, also observing strict ROE with regards to civilians). We hope these additions will provide more vanilla tools for doing so. <\/li> <li><strong>Roleplay<\/strong> - military and civilian roleplayers alike have access to more relevant vanilla vehicles and character gear to use in their favorite flavor of gameplay. <\/li> <li><strong>Creators<\/strong> - there is a lot of new content to build and play with! There are very many brand-new props to place in <a href=\"https:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Eden_Editor\" target=\"_blank\">Eden Editor<\/a>, all of them free for all players. Then there are some basic components of the IDAP faction that are platform (existing vehicles, aid worker clothes, etc.), and enhancements that do require ownership (van, drone, etc.). Because of our established <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bistudio.com\/blog\/roadmap-14-15-dlc-strategy-blog\" target=\"_blank\">DLC strategy<\/a>, you can also use premium assets in scenarios that even non-owners will be able to play (with exceptions for active usage). IDAP can quite easily operate on the battlefield in military scenarios regardless of players owning the DLC. <\/li> <\/ul> <p>Are there things that would fit the theme but are not represented? Sure, there are more things we'd love to have added, but we have to remain realistic. And doing something with this theme was important to us. We've tried to build a balanced package with cool additions for everyone.

In one of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bistudio.com\/blog\/scanning-the-horizon-arma-3-in-2017\" target=\"_blank\">news articles<\/a> on the Bohemia Interactive website in March, we announced the price of the \"Orange DLC\" as € 6.99 \/ $ 7.99 \/ £ 5.99. However, during its development, the \"Orange\" package grew beyond our initial expectations in terms of content and concept. For this reason, we decided that when the \"Orange DLC\" will first go on sale\/pre-order, it will be priced the same as our other <b>full-sized DLC<\/b>, such as the recent Arma 3 Jets, at € 9.99 \/ $ 11.99 \/ £ 8.99. The price of the <a href=\"http:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/612480\/Arma_3_DLC_Bundle_2\/\" target=\"_blank\">DLC Bundle 2<\/a>, which was already on sale and includes the \"Orange DLC\", <b>will not be changed<\/b>. Effectively this means that people who have purchased or will purchase the DLC Bundle 2 will get more value for the same price. Although we cannot provide any more details just yet without spoiling the surprise, we can already say that this package will be a very interesting and worthwhile addition to the Arma 3 experience - and we hope you'll feel the same way after seeing the full incoming reveal announcement! Later, as with many other major additions to Arma 3, we'll also be publishing a <b>developer diary video<\/b> to introduce this project a little bit further.
